"Okay, so [boys and girls] we’re starting our math [lesson], okay.  So you guys we’re doing like a regular math [block] today.  Looking up on the chalkboard, looking up on the chalkboard is something you worked on yesterday, something you worked on yesterday. Can someone say what you see up on the chalk – on the board – on the [Inaudible] from yesterday? So what do you see?",teacher,68,0,,,1.0
"I see paper with the thing we were doing yesterday, [the pointy end], like seeing how many cubes can fit in the box.",student,23,1,,0.0,
"So I hear someone saying two things, or two vocabulary words jumped up; cubes.  How many cubes fit in a box?  Okay, [Student F] what more can you say?",teacher,29,2,1.0,,1.0
"And like [vowels], like he said about the cubes in the thing and the box.  And on the other side, on the pattern, on the black paper it has the numbers of the [Inaudible].",student,34,1,,0.0,
Are the numbers of the cubes that are in the box.  What more can we say?  Student S and then Student A.,teacher,22,1,1.0,,1.0
"I see, I see three boxes, three patterns, that you can do to see if, um, how many cubes could fit in one box.",student,24,1,,0.0,
How many cubes in one box.  There are patterns that we know were cut out and taped to go in these boxes.  There’s some more words that go with this.  Student A?,teacher,32,1,1.0,,0.0
"Yeah, it’s like, for example, um, yesterday we, in our [Inaudible], we were filling up the cubes and [how long] like the geography.  Will, like – well, we put it in.  We figured out by counting how much are in each side and [timing] it by common sides [long].",student,49,1,,0.0,
"So, do you – you multiplied numbers, [you say]?  Student K?",teacher,11,1,0.0,,1.0
"I like the [Inaudible] that actually [Inaudible] we were putting them in the bottom of dimensions, the second layer, and we were adding up the four sides so then we can know how much to put on the first layer, so then we could [Inaudible] use the same number on the other layer and [Inaudible].",student,55,1,,1.0,
"So, I hear two words in there.  You have [two layers] and volume.  And volume meaning how many cubes are in the box, as Student R said earlier.  Student E?",teacher,30,3,1.0,,0.0
We were trying to figure out what was the volume of the box.,student,13,1,,0.0,
"Figure out what the volume of the box is.  Okay.  So, boys and girls, today we’re going to do something similar.  We’re going to build on what we did yesterday.  We’re going to keep going over it.  We’re going to [seek] some kids [touching cubics]. Anyone want to take a guess on what we might be working on today? [There] are hints up here, I guess.  Student J, for our [objective].",teacher,71,1,1.0,,0.0

"Mm-hm.  How many in each box.  So we’re going to be working on how many cubes in a box, which is volume.  Please, open your math books to [one-five-eleven].  Our goal for today; please write down the word objectives.  Sometimes you write the word mission. Write that down.  Yes, please put this in your notebook. My goal [is for you] to create a model with cubes.  So, you’re going to make a model with cubes to show different strategies to determine the volume of a box.  Or, I heard someone say another word yesterday or even this morning. How do we describe the box?  Something special about these boxes? Just like we used the [cards] earlier; what type of box?",teacher,120,5,1.0,,0.0
Three-D.,student,1,0,,,
Three-D; three-dimensional box.  Three-D.,teacher,4,1,,,0.0
And [they] have different things.,student,5,0,,,
"Yeah.  So that’s going to be your mission today.  It is very much the same as yesterday except today you’re going to make models with the cubes to prove you know the volume of the boxes. So these were the boxes you worked with yesterday.  Take a look at page 7 in your book [work].  So, page 7, if you look at the first two patterns, the first two patterns. You can see there’s a pattern and you can see there’s a picture in those boxes – of those boxes.  There’s also a little column, it says ‘first answer’ and ‘actual answer.’",teacher,102,2,0.0,,0.0
"And also we’re going to [estimate], right?",student,7,1,,,
"Student S was saying we’re going to estimate or we’re going to take our prediction of how many you think will fit into the box.  So right now, please, for number one, please look at number one and please write down your first answer, which is sort of like what I heard Student S say; your estimate, or it could be your prediction. So, number one, and then take a look at number two.  Take your guess. Please, don’t look at someone else’s.  There’s no wrong answers because it’s your prediction or your estimate of how many cubes will fit in that box.",teacher,103,4,1.0,,0.0
So we could do a second one too?,student,8,0,,0.0,

I have a pile for page two for number [seven]. One student at your table, I know we kind of redid jobs since we moved people around.

I might ask you to prove how you know how many cubes [there are]. I want you to find different strategies to make models with your cubes, to show what the volume is – to show what the volume is.  Student J?",teacher,81,5,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"No, we’ll pass them to you.  We’ll pass them to you.  Good question. So, you’re going to make models with your cubes.  If you find one strategy – we [Inaudible] different strategies yesterday.  You’re going to find another two.  You want to find – our goal is to find different strategies; multiple strategies. Okay, how about Student J and we’ve got [Inaudible].  Will you grab those for your table, please?  And would Student I and Student V, would you grab the materials for your table, please.",teacher,86,2,,,0.0

"I want you to show your strategy with the cubes, yep.  Okay, so go ahead boys and girls.  Go ahead and work [with] your tables.  Good. Yep.  So now, just like yesterday, fold them. Yeah, Student J, here’s the tape, so put that together.  Leave one side out now. So, boys and girls, I’ve been walking around and looking at the kids who are showing they’re proving to me, not because they found the answers, but they’re proving to me how they know it; proving to me how they know how many cubes fit in the box; the volume. We put ten minutes up – excuse me.  I want to put three more minutes because there’s two tables I haven’t got a chance to check in with.  Three more minutes to finish one and two; finish one and two.  So go ahead for three minutes. Okay.  Boys and girls, please put [counters] down.  We’re going to talk about how you proved the volume of these boxes. Let’s see, I see one, two, three tables ready.  I see four; however, we’re waiting for one student. Good.  Five, six, seven, eight.  Okay.  So, boys and girls, and can I ask Student A and Student X turn your chairs, please, this way.  You can’t go up to the [Inaudible]. So, let’s start.  Let’s look at number one, boys and girls.  Let’s look at number one.  I’m going to ask a few kids to come on up if they can to share how they prove how many cubes are in number one. We all figured out – let’s just put it up there.  What was the – what was the volume of number one?  What was the volume of number one?  Student S?",teacher,289,7,1.0,,0.0
Sixteen.  Sixteen cubic units.,student,4,2,,,
"Correct.  Sixteen cubic units.  Okay, so first, Student S, would you mind kind of coming up and showing the class the [colors] you have?  Come on up here, please.

I want you to know this one because we’re going to get to why there’s three dimensions.  Turn and talk for at least 30 seconds.  Where is the 1 by 4 in Student J’s model? He says 1 by 4 by 4.  How did he get 1 times 4?  First, where is the one coming from in his model?  Hold it up again Student J, and show them.  Turn and talk for 30 seconds.  Where is he getting 1 times 4 from?      30 seconds, please, to think where’s he getting… Ten seconds, please. Okay, that was a few seconds more than 30.  Okay, finish your last sentences.  Please, turn up to the front.  Please, turn up to the front.  Could someone – would someone mind telling us where was the 1 times 4?  We know 1 times 4 just makes 4, so where is 1 times 4 on that model?  Student K?",teacher,217,1,1.0,,0.0

Did you want to show the model you made?  You [filled] up all the green and white… So, now, if you pulled that down, so we can see the colors, maybe. Now, boys and girls, take a look at Student J’s model, please. Where is that 1 times 4?  Where is that 1 times 4?  Where is that 1 times 4?  Student [Inaudible].",teacher,90,2,,,1.0

Maybe because it’s four stories.,student,5,0,,,
Four stories.  What do you see that makes you say there’s four stories?,teacher,13,0,1.0,,1.0

"So with the way we solved the – how to get the answer, it – we [counted] this in 5’s, so we got 5 [times] 15 and then there’s – if you go like this, there’s two right here going down, so then we added 15 to 15 and it equals 30.  So we got 30 cubic units.",student,58,2,,1.0,

He says he counted 6 times 5 in here.  What do you see that could have made him say 6 times 5?  What do you see on here that might have made him 6 times 5, and I’ll hold it still. What do you see that maybe made him say 6 times 5?  Talk about it for like 20 seconds, please.  Turn and talk for like 20 seconds.  What do you see that maybe made him say 6 times 5?

What Student X said is correct; 6 times 5 makes 30.  There’s 30 in here. We all ready know, from yesterday and today, it’s not two numbers. It’s three numbers.  It’s three-D.

He made a model, two groups of six, and Student H explained it to me, and that worked but that’s two-dimension still. So how is – how – what are the three dimensions and does that work? Look at your paper, please.  Flip to page 8.  Flip to page 8, please.  The first one says, “3 by 4 by 3.” So, please take your notebook.  Please, take your notebook. I want to write a little – I want to write a little exit journal.  I want to write a little exit journal.  So number three on page 8…  So, please write down 3 times 4 times 3.

You can explain it in words or make a model.  This is kind of where our next step is today. I think you boys and girls – I think you’ve got this thing.  You made the models prove how many cubes were in there, but tomorrow, [I wonder] three-dimensions.  How – why three- dimensions?  Why not two-dimensions or why not four- dimensions?
