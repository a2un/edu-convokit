"I'm wondering which is bigger, one half or two thirds. Now  before you model it you might think in your head, before you begin  to model it what you is bigger and if so, if one is bigger, by how  much. Why don’t you work with your partner and see what you can  do.",T,54,,0.0,
"Try the purples. Get three purples. It doesn’t work, try the greens",[STUDENT_0],12,0.0,,
What was it? Two thirds?,[STUDENT_1],5,,,
It would be like brown or something like that.,[STUDENT_0],9,0.0,,
Ok,[STUDENT_1],1,,,
"We’re not doing the one third, we’re doing two thirds. That is one  third",[STUDENT_0],14,0.0,,
First we’ve got to find out what a third of it is. What’s a third of an  orange?,[STUDENT_1],18,0.0,,
One third?,[STUDENT_0],2,,,
"What’s third of an orange? Let’s start a different model. The green. The green, half of it is the  light green",[STUDENT_1],21,0.0,,
"Alright, yeah, I was thinking of that way before",[STUDENT_0],9,0.0,,
"And you can take the take the red, and the light green, and put it up  to it , it’s, she asked, is one half bigger than,  what did she ask? What did she ask?",[STUDENT_1],35,0.0,,
"She asked, which is bigger, one half or two thirds?",[STUDENT_0],10,0.0,,
One half or two thirds? Now take six of the ones,[STUDENT_1],11,0.0,,
"Yeah, I know, and put ‘em up to there, and that would be one sixth. Hey, wait a minute, hey wait, maybe that’s it, yeah it’s bigger by one  sixth",[STUDENT_0],30,0.0,,
Now take six of the ones Which is bigger?,T,9,,0.0,1.0
One half ,[STUDENT_2],2,,,
I think one half is...,[STUDENT_0],5,,,
"Yes, [STUDENT_0] and [STUDENT_1]?",T,4,,0.0,0.0
What do you have?,[STUDENT_0],4,,,
Well,[STUDENT_1] and [STUDENT_0],1,,,
we think,[STUDENT_0],2,,,
two thirds,[STUDENT_1],2,,,
is bigger than,[STUDENT_1] and [STUDENT_0],3,,,
You both agree?,T,3,,0.0,
one half by one sixth. Cause if you put six ones up to a whole,[STUDENT_1],15,1.0,,
dark green,[STUDENT_0],2,,,
If you put it up to a whole,[STUDENT_1],8,0.0,,
"I’m sorry, what’s the number name for dark green",T,9,,0.0,0.0
One,[STUDENT_1] and [STUDENT_0],1,,,
Ok.,T,1,,0.0,
And you put six ones up to the dark green,[STUDENT_1],10,0.0,,
"Hold on, I’m a little confused. Tell me again. Six ones? You called  this one? What are you calling these?",T,20,,1.0,1.0
One sixth,[STUDENT_1],2,,,
One sixth.,T,2,,0.0,
"And then these, this would be",[STUDENT_0],6,,,
"We’re calling them each sixths,",[STUDENT_1],5,,,
Ok,T,1,,0.0,0.0
So there’s six sixths,[STUDENT_1],4,,,
"This would be one third, and this is one half of  dark green, and then it would be bigger by one sixth, because",[STUDENT_0],23,1.0,,
Do you both agree with that?,T,6,,0.0,0.0
"Yeah, mm hmm.",[STUDENT_1],3,,,
"Ok, could you write that up? Uh, let me get you some paper, I want  you to write that up. And see if you can make me - if it works for  other models because some students don’t believe that it works for  other models and I think you two believe that it works for other  models",T,57,,0.0,
"Mmm hmm, yeah",[STUDENT_1],3,,,
"So can you try to find some so that you can try to convince them that  it should work for other models, and come up with a way of  explaining it to the class, ok? That if it works, if you really believe it,  that if it works for one it works for others, and then write this up, let  me get you some paper.",T,65,,0.0,
"Seven, nine, ten, I need them. Go get another box.",[STUDENT_1],10,0.0,,
Ok I see you had your hands up  over here?,T 2,10,,,
Yeah,[STUDENT_1],1,,,
Let me come around and see what you’re doing.,T 2,9,,,
We found two answers,[STUDENT_1],4,,,
"Well, I have three.",[STUDENT_0],4,,,
"You have two solutions... three. Ok, let me hear about one of these  models. Here, which one do you want to tell me about?",T 2,24,,,
That one.,[STUDENT_1],2,,,
"Yeah, that's an interesting looking one, tell me about it.",T 2,10,,,
Now if you call this rod one...,[STUDENT_1],7,,,
The orange and red together?,T 2,5,,,
"Yeah, and you take the two dark green rods, those are the halves... And you take two  thirds, and put it up to it, and you take... two sixths, it's bigger than  two sixths. And  in this one, it you take this ...",[STUDENT_1],43,0.0,,
Can we go back to that one again?,T 2,8,,,
"I mean it's bigger than one tenth, I mean twelfth, one twelfth, one  twelfth.",[STUDENT_1],14,1.0,,
"How does that work? I'm confused about that. I’m confused about  the little white rods, I am following you right up to that point.",T 2,24,,,
"If you put the white rods up to here, there's twelve of them, and  then you call them twelfths, because there are twelve of them.",[STUDENT_1],25,0.0,,
"All right, okay.",T 2,3,,,
"And then you take the two thirds, and you take two twelfths, and  then you put it up to the thirds and it is bigger by  two tens... two twelfths.",[STUDENT_1],30,0.0,,
"By two twelfths, okay.",T 2,4,,,
If you use this model...,[STUDENT_1],5,,,
Uh hmm.,T 2,2,,,
And if you use this model,[STUDENT_1],6,,,
Uh hmm.,T 2,2,,,
"And you call these sixths, and you put  this one up to it and it is bigger than one  sixth.",[STUDENT_1],20,0.0,,
"Okay, so here it was bigger by two twelfths and here it was bigger  by one sixth.",T 2,17,,,
Yeah.,[STUDENT_1],1,,,
That's interesting. Could we call the difference between the two  thirds and the one half in this model another number name besides two twelfths?,T 2,24,,,
"Um, yeah, well, maybe...",[STUDENT_1],4,,,
"You said two of those little white ones were two twelfths, right?",T 2,12,,,
"Yeah, and maybe since two of these little white ones equals up to  one of these or it's one fifth, oh, I mean one sixth, the reds",[STUDENT_1],27,1.0,,
"Oh, that's interesting, that's kind of interesting, then, so if you then  used the reds to describe the difference, you could call this one sixth,  the difference.",T 2,27,,,
Uh hmm.,[STUDENT_1],2,,,
And over here one of the whites you say is one sixth?,T 2,12,,,
Yeah.,[STUDENT_1],1,,,
"Oh, that’s interesting, two different models. Okay.",T 2,7,,,
