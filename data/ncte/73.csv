All right.  Today we’re gonna work on how many packages fit in Box 2.  I’ve given you Box 2.  I want you to look at it and notice what is different from Box 1 that we used on Tuesday.  What do you notice about it?,teacher,45,0,,,1.0
[Inaudible] The height is [Inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
Ooh!  The height is bigger.  Anybody else notice that the height is bigger?,teacher,13,0,1.0,,1.0
Yep.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  Can you look back in your book and can you tell me the dimensions of the Box 1?  And then we’ll compare them to the dimensions of Box 2.,teacher,30,2,,,0.0
[Box 1]?,student,2,0,,,
"Student K, what were the dimensions of Box 1?",teacher,9,1,,,0.0
Four by six by three.,student,5,0,,,
"So, Box 1 was a four by six by three.  Now look at Box 2 that you have in front of you and tell me the dimensions. Student L?",teacher,29,1,1.0,,0.0
Four by six by [five].,student,5,0,,,
Okay.  Make a comparison.  Student A?,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
They both have the same two numbers – they both have the four and the six.,student,16,0,,1.0,
The length –,teacher,3,1,0.0,,0.0
And the width.,student,3,0,,,
And the width stayed the same.,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
The height changed.,student,3,0,,,
The height changed.,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Two layers.,student,2,0,,,
"Two more layers were added.  Very good.  Two more layers are added.  All right.  Packages A, D and E are the same.  Can you read the directions for me, Student J?  On Page 23.",teacher,34,0,,,0.0
Now look at Packages A and D and E and Box 2.  How many of each package will fit in this box?  Determine the answer before [Inaudible].  [Record] your first answer and the actual answer below.,student,36,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  So, before we even start, that first answer you’re taking an educated guess of how many packages you think are gonna go in there.  So, can you look right now at your paper and take that guess?",teacher,38,0,1.0,,0.0
Six.,student,1,0,,,
First answer is your guess.,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Once you’re done that, put your hands on your head so I know you’re ready for the next step.  Where is your book?",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
What have you been doing? [Whispering Inaudible],student,7,0,,,
So you’re making an educated guess how many packages do you think – how many packages of A do you think are gonna fit in Box 2?  How many of D?  How many of E?,teacher,35,0,0.0,,0.0
[Whispering] like this?,student,3,0,,,
"Nope.     You could.  Remember we said you could move them around but you couldn’t break them apart?  All right.  It looks like everybody is finished.  Or finishing up.  All right.  So, your task for today I wrote it up here.  This should be very familiar with you because you did pretty much the same kind of task with Box 1.  Now you’re gonna do it with Box 2.  So you’re to complete how many packages in Box 2. Student L brought up a good point.  She said if she had Box D would I need to have it standing up like this?  Who can answer that?",teacher,106,0,,,0.0
No.  It doesn’t actually matter ‘cause it’s the same thing.,student,10,0,,1.0,
"You can have it laying down in the box.  You can have it standing up in the box.  But you just can’t break it apart, in half, or anything like that.  You can’t break any pieces off of it.  Does that make sense?",teacher,43,0,0.0,,0.0
Could there be two different answers? No.,student,7,0,,,
That’s a good question.  Student R said could there be more than one answer and I think Student A and Student G the last time they had that happen to them where they had two different answers because one answer they had they used the boxes laying down.  Another one they used it standing up.,teacher,55,0,1.0,,0.0
So shall we put a slash?,student,6,0,,,
What do you think you should write down?  If you were packaging –,teacher,13,0,0.0,,0.0
"So if we use it both ways should we put [Inaudible] like this, put that answer and then a slash?",student,20,0,,0.0,
"Well, let me ask you something.  If you owned a packaging company and you were spending money shipping all these packages, do you think that you would want to have the most packages that you could fit in Box 1?  Why?",teacher,41,0,0.0,,1.0
‘Cause – to save money.,student,5,0,,,
"Yeah.  You’re saving money.  You get to pack more packages in the box.  That’s our goal.  Pack as many as you can fit in the box.  If you happen to finish this, your sponge activity.  I put them in this order for a reason.  25 and 26 would have been your homework but since we had two snow days I’m gonna use it as a sponge activity.  If you happen to finish those, which I don’t think you will, your other assignment would have been 24.  Okay?  This is a review sheet, 24.",teacher,93,0,1.0,,0.0
We don’t have –,student,4,0,,,
Stop me before lunch so that we can share out so that I have enough time.,teacher,16,0,,,0.0

"Ms. S, what if we all disagree on Box A?",student,10,0,,0.0,
"If you disagree, how do you disagree?",teacher,7,0,1.0,,1.0
Because he thinks it’s 12.  I think it’s 8.,student,9,0,,1.0,
You think 12 are gonna fit in?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,

"This is Box A.  If you put two right there and [Inaudible] and two right here, that’s four.  And two right here and two right here, that’s eight.",student,28,0,,0.0,
Okay.  You’re supposed to be shipping them in this box so you have to figure out –,teacher,17,0,1.0,,0.0
It has to fit in here?,student,6,0,,,
Mm-hm.,teacher,1,0,1.0,,0.0
That’s nothing like that.,student,4,0,,,
"No, here.",teacher,2,0,,,0.0
This is Box A.,student,4,0,,,

What do you think?,teacher,4,0,0.0,,1.0
Or leave it like that?,student,5,0,,,
Are you asking me if you need to actually build another one? What do you think?,teacher,16,0,0.0,,1.0
"Yeah, because it’s three more layers so we have to build three more layers.",student,14,0,,1.0,
"If it helps you to build them, then you can build them.  See how Student M’s moving them around?  That’s okay, too.",teacher,22,0,1.0,,0.0

So rip out 15?,student,4,0,,,
Now you can have them side by side.  That’s fine.,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
"So, what are you gonna do next? What are we supposed to do, Teacher?",student,14,0,,0.0,
So I want you to compare the volume from Box 1 with the volume in Box 2.  What do you notice?,teacher,21,2,0.0,,1.0

E was 12 and it was double.,student,7,0,,,

Eight.  It’s eight.,student,3,0,,,
I hear eight.  I see six.  I heard 12.  I want – so obviously we don’t all agree so I want you to construct a bunch of them and I’ll be right back.,teacher,33,0,,,0.0
