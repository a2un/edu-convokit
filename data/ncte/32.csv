"It’s time for math.  So today we’re going to be adding fractions, and I want you to take a look at these two fractions on the overhead:  one-half plus one-sixth.  And take a minute and talk about with your teams.  What would be the sum of these two fractions?  The total.  When you’re adding these two fractions, what is the sum of these two fractions?  Take a minute. All right.  I hear you using percents.  That’s excellent.  Okay.  So taking a look at one-half plus one-sixth, what is the sum of these two fractions, Student A?",teacher,96,11,,,0.0

Two-sixths?  Anything else?  Student J?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"One-half plus one-sixth equals two-thirds.  Now, what I want you to do, using the same to determine which one is correct, I want you to take a look at the four by six rectangular grids, and using these rectangular grids – I want you to almost think of this as like a pan of brownies or a cake, a birthday cake.  And thinking about what one half is and then adding one-sixth. Because before, you didn’t have this representation.  Now, taking a look – and you’re really just looking at one of these.  How would I go about showing one-half plus one-sixth on here?  Take a minute and talk about it with your teams. So this is how you’re going to actually prove it, Student K.  So you’re saying one-half, go down the middle?  About five seconds left, please.  Five seconds left. I’m getting videotaped right now.  That’s okay.  Thank you.  Okay. So, taking a look at one-half plus one-sixth, who’d like to come up and show us, using our four by six.  Student M, come on up.  And I want you to talk yourself through it. Talk us through it. Talk about what one-half is and when you’re adding one-sixth.",teacher,201,2,,,1.0
[Inaudible] so a half of 6 equals [inaudible].,student,8,0,,0.0,
Three columns?,teacher,2,0,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  So what is that representing?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0
A half.,student,2,0,,,
"So that’s one half.  Can you just write one-half, either under it or above it, so we can see what you’re talking about? Okay.",teacher,24,0,,,0.0
"And then, there is one-sixth, so you do another column and there are two left, two-sixths left.",student,17,0,,1.0,
Okay.  So what is one-half plus one-sixth?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,0.0
Four-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
"Four-sixths.  Excellent.  So is there anyone who did it differently?  Excellent.  You can go back.  So what’s going to happen in the next couple of weeks, we’re going to be adding fractions.  And we’re going to be adding fractions, not with the same denominator but different denominators. I want you to take a look at this large clock face. Imagine that the minute hand is not going to move.  Here is the minute hand.  It will not move.  If you look at our large clock face over there – unfortunately, it doesn’t work, so I want you to think about our clock that we’re going to use today.  So the minute hand is not moving; it’s broken.  The hour hand actually moves around.  How many parts are there to this clock, to make it a whole?  How many parts are there to this clock to actually make it a whole?",teacher,150,6,,,1.0
Twelve?,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah.  Nice job, Student O.  There are 12 parts.  So I want you to imagine that the minute hand is stuck on the 12.  The hour hand is the only hand that moves.  The hour hand moves and it’s stopped on the 1.  What fraction of our clock moved?  Student P?",teacher,51,1,,,0.0

One-fourth?,student,1,0,,,
"So you’re saying that this is three-twelfths, Student K?",teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,

Both.,student,1,0,,,
They’re both correct.  Explain to me why.  Justify your answer.,teacher,10,0,,,1.0

"Three-twelfths equals one-fourth.  So we move three-twelfths around the clock and we move one-fourth.  Now, how many minutes have gone by?  How many minutes on my clock have gone by?  Student J?",teacher,32,0,,,0.0
15.,student,1,0,,,
"15 minutes have gone by.  My whole has changed, though, so 15 minutes out of how many minutes have gone by?  15 minutes out of how many minutes?  So we moved three twelfths around the clock.  We’ve also moved one-fourth, which means those two fractions are equal.  They are equivalent fractions. Student K?",teacher,53,3,,,0.0
60.,student,1,0,,,
"60 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour.  I’m going to be passing around a clock right now.  Paper passers.  You’re not cutting it out, no.  You’re just actually using this just as a tool to help you find the next fraction. So just write your name on this.  Is there anyone who did not get a clock?  Student K did not get one.  Okay.  So again, I want you to think about the hour hand not moving, it’s broken, it’s stuck, and it’s stuck on the 12.  I want you to imagine the hour hand moving one-third around this clock. One-third around the clock.  Where would my hour hand stop – and I want you to actually draw it on your clock.  So here I’m at one whole.  Now I’m going to move one-third around my clock, which means that this clock is going to be broken up into thirds.  Where is one-third? [0:12:18] Student J, go ahead and show us what one-third looks like on our clock.  You can draw it on the transparency.  How did you know that that was one-third?  What did you determine to get that answer?",teacher,193,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible] because I know 4 times 3 equals 12.,student,9,0,,1.0,
"So you multiplied 3 by 4 by 4 three times and you got 12.  So what is another equivalent fraction to one-third?  What is one-third also equal to?  Looking at our clock, what is one- third.

I know that this is equal to one-third.  What is two-thirds equal to?  If I take that much out of my clock, if I cut that out, I know that this represents one-third.  So what would another third be?

And what you’re going to do is you’re going to be working with partners in the room – you will not be leaving the classroom – and you’re going to find the fractions for each clock.  So let’s take a look at number one.  Let’s do number one together.  That clock represents what fraction, Student O?  Number one represents what fraction?",teacher,97,4,,,0.0
One-twelfth?,student,1,0,,,
"One-twelfth.  So in that square, in that box, I would write one- twelfth.  What else does it represent?  Thinking about how much time has gone by, how much time has gone by.

One-sixth.,student,1,0,,,
It equals one-sixth.  How did you know it equaled one-sixth?,teacher,10,0,,,1.0

"Let’s look at this.  First take a look at this.  We know this. How did we get that?  You’re right, Student B.  You did do something.  You multiplied 6 by 2.  But what did you do to the 12, then, to get 6?",teacher,43,1,,,1.0
Divided it.,student,2,1,,,
You divided it by 2.  And what did you do up here?,teacher,12,1,,,1.0

Ten-sixtieths.,student,1,0,,,
"Sixtieths.  Excellent.  So what you’re going to do is you’re going to find as many equivalent fractions for each one of these clocks, and you’re going to be writing them on the same box.  Now, I want you to take a look at number 12. There are a lot of equivalent fractions for one whole. Just list maybe three or four equivalent fractions.  In about 20 minutes or so, 15 minutes, we’re going to come back together and we’re going to start using our clocks to add fractions.  So, for example, I know that this is one- sixths, and if I add one-half I’m going to get eight- twelfths.  So you’re going to be using these clocks to add fractions.  I’m going to ask you to quietly pick a partner – in a minute, in a minute, Student M.  Before you even write down your answer, I want you to talk about the whole and the part of the clock.  You’re not going to go out in the hallway and you don’t need chairs.  You can just sit around the room or desks.  Any questions?  You may quietly find your partner. Yes.  If you want to work – if you feel that you want to work by yourself, that’s fine, too. Everyone should have a partner by now.  If you don’t, then you can just quietly work alone.  So you have about 15 minutes. Just find an area, Student J.  You can sit on the floor, you can sit over there.  You don’t need the chairs, though. This is only going to take about 15 minutes, and then we’ll come together as a class. How many minutes have gone by?",teacher,280,11,,,0.0

How many?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
30.,student,1,0,,,

"Okay.  I need you to work on this rather than scribbling.  Do you understand?  Thank you.  Don’t forget to use other clocks that you have found to help you find the answer to other clocks.  So for example, I’m looking at number four and number four might help me with number eight.  Oh yeah, for number six, let’s say three.  Three or four.  For number six, for one-half, there are lots and lots of fractions that are equal to one-half. Nice job.  How did you get five-sixths?",teacher,87,1,0.0,,1.0

Two hours?,student,2,0,,,

So you need to determine, find out how many sixths that clock is equal to. Is it an emergency?  Go ahead.  Raise your hand if you are finished. Okay.  If you are finished using your clocks, I would like for you to add these fractions in your math notebook.  If you’re finished.

This doesn’t just equal ten-twelfths or fifty- sixtieths. What other equivalent fraction does this equal?  So Student M, take a look.  I know that this is two-twelfths.

This will probably help you with that.  I want you to use your clock to help you with these fractions.  So, I’m going to ask you to go back to your desks, please, so we can move on to now using our clocks to add fractions.  I need everyone to go back to their desk. So Team Three is ready to move on.  Okay.  So we’re now going to use our clock to add fractions.  We’re also going to use smaller clocks. I’d like for you to look at page 38 and 39. You’re going to be using those smaller clocks to add fractions.  But before we do that, let’s take a look at our larger clock.  You’re also going to want to use page 37 to help you with this.  I’m looking to add one-fourth plus one- third.  What will that look like on my click. Now, I know when I’m thinking about one-fourth, I’m actually visualizing.  It doesn’t matter what clock I look at.  It doesn’t matter if I look at this clock.  It doesn’t matter if I look at the clock on the wall.  I know what one-fourth looks like.  If I look at it as a whole – even if there are no numbers – I know what one-fourth looks like.  I also know what one-third looks like.  I know when one-fourth goes by three hours have passed.

"I don’t know it off the top of my head, honey.  I mean, I could find out, but you don’t need to worry about the percent, what percent seven-twelfths is equal to now.  You need to know your fourths, your fifths, your sixths, your thirds. One-twelfth is half of one-sixth, so thinking about one- sixth being sixteen and two-thirds, what would be half of sixteen?  But we’ll revisit that another time.  Right now I just want to look at adding fractions, okay? I want you to now, on your large clock, I want you to add one-third plus one-sixth.  Do that right now, please.  On your large yellow clock that I passed out.  I want you to add one- third plus one-sixth.  So I want you to take a look at page 37.  Here’s page 37.

Do I need that there?,student,5,0,,,
"Yeah, because remember the twelfths.  The minute hand is not moving.  Only the hour hand. So the minute hand is always staying at 12.  Okay.  So now put one-third here, so you know that that equals one-third.  How many hours went by? Let’s see.",teacher,44,0,0.0,,0.0

And then when I added one-third, I labeled my piece one-third.  I need to be able to see you labeling your clocks.  So if one- sixth is half of one-third, what is one-sixth equal to? How many hours?

"Two thumbs up, if Student N is correct.  One-third plus one- sixth equals one-half.  Nice job.  Excellent.  Okay.  So let’s open up to page 38, and I want you to work on page 38 right now.  Adding fractions.  If you need a new yellow clock – because that one is all marked up – raise your hand.  You also have the smaller clocks on there.  So let’s take a look at number one.  For each fraction addition problem, show your work in the clock.  So for number one, you need to show me what one-fourth looks like plus one- half.  You’re actually showing me just the way we’ve been working on the larger clocks.  These clocks are smaller. But if you need more, I’m going to be passing this out. You may get started.  And you’re working on this independently. [0:47:00] You’re just working on page 38.  Okay, Student M.  So if you know that this is one-fourth, what does one-half look like? Show me here, what does one-half look like on this clock? On this one.  Just use your finger and show me what one- half looks like.  Okay.  So how many hours is that?",teacher,196,3,1.0,,0.0

"Okay.  So if you’re here and you need to add 6 more hours, where are you going to land?  Show me what one-half looks like on this clock.",teacher,28,1,,,0.0
Down here?,student,2,0,,,
"Well, no, because you’re already at one-fourth right here, so this is representing one-fourth.  But now you need to use the rest of the clock to show me one-half.  You just told me that 6 hours, or six-twelfths is one-half, so can you add twelfths?  Here’s one-twelfth.",teacher,47,1,,,0.0

So would you say that this is a half?  Okay.  So show me half. And label it.  Okay.  So what does one-fourth plus one-half equal?,teacher,25,0,,,0.0
Nine-twelfths.,student,1,0,,,
"And what does nine-twelfths also equal to?  I want to draw it on here, okay, because I want you to see.  Here’s one- fourth, and then here’s one-half, so it’s going like this. How much of the clock is shaded in?  Student K, don’t worry about it.  It’s just the door making noises.  Can you turn around please?  I’ll be right with you.  Turn around.  If this is one-fourth, what’s this little part here?  Two- fourths.",teacher,76,0,,,0.0
Three-fourths.,student,1,0,,,
So nine-twelfths is also equal to what?,teacher,7,0,,,1.0

"One whole and one-twelfth.  Nice job.  You have less than a minute. Okay.  So let’s take a look at number one.  Number one.  Student D, read number one to me.  What does it say?",teacher,34,1,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"One-fourth plus one-half equals something.  One-fourth plus one- half equals something.  Using our clocks – now, you should be able to visualize, using our clock, what one-fourth looks like.  You should be able to visualize what one-half looks like.  Student D, why don’t you come up and show us. So what is that?",teacher,53,0,,,0.0
One-half.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  And so what does it equal?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0

"That also equals three-fourths.  Nice job.  Okay.  So for homework tonight, let’s take a look at our homework for this evening.  You are finishing up page 38 and page 39.  I want you to right now write two fractions for clock number four that you will add.  I want the denominators to be different.  I don’t want you to add one-fourth plus three- fourths.  I want the denominators to be different.  So looking at number four, write down two fractions that you’ll add.  So what plus what.  And the tonight for homework you’ll add those two fractions. Number five.  Do the same for number five.  Do you want to come up with a fraction or do you want me to write it?  How about this.  I’m going to do it for you.  So I want you to add those two, and I want you to use this clock.  Any questions about your homework this evening? Okay.  That is the end.",teacher,160,11,,,0.0
