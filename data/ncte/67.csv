You keep taking it apart, and you can't remember how it goes back together, so here.  Look at mine. What do you see?  Student N, just look at mine.  What kind of design are the cubes making, or shape?  Look at it.  I'm asking you to look at something and describe what you see. You can't say, ""I don't know to that.""  Look at it.  Don't look around.  Look at the shape.  What do you see?  What is this, Student N?  Is it curvy?  Is it a square?  Is it a triangle?  What is it?  It's not going to be an, ""I don't know."", Student N.  We've got to stop doing that.  I'm asking you to look at something and tell me what you see. You can't be wrong, and you can't not know, because I know you can see it.  Student N, stop trying to figure out the one that's in your hands.  You took it apart, and now it's not the right way.

These are the buildings we just made.  Now we're going to draw what we saw.  As you look at this paper that I just gave you – looking at your paper, it says, ""Make each building with cubes, and then draw the silhouettes for both.""  You're going to make this building.  Remember, this is the building that we made just a minute ago.  What it asked you to draw, the silhouettes.  You're going to draw the silhouette from the front, from the top, and from the right, and if you look up here, it reminds you what the front is, what the top is, and where the right is, so I don't want anybody saying, ""I didn't know what to draw."" It's right there for you, okay?  Let's do this one together.  Where did my pen go?  Oh yeah.  Look at building number one.  You can make it if you want, or you can look. Here's my building.

Can I ask you something?  Why are you scribbling it like that?  Is that our neatest work?  Draw a line, draw a line, and then color it in.  Student S, you don't need to make the first one because we already did it up there, so now copy that and go on to the second one.  Cuidado.  Mira, mira.  [Speaking Spanish].

Is the lead I gave you?  This probably needs a number five, not a number seven.  What are you drawing? [Inaudible].  Stay inside.  You've got to work on the messiness.  There's no reason for [inaudible].  Let's look at this together.  This has two going across.  Why is there a big square?  Why don't you try making this bigger?  I see that, okay.  I get it now.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go on to the back, Student F.  Let's check this, the right side. They're not all going to look the same, sweetie.  It's a different shape.  For homework you're going to finish this. My voice is on, so I should see all eyes up here.  For homework you're going to finish this paper, then we've got something that's very simple.  This one just asks how many cubes does it take to build this?  Really easy.  You don't have to draw anything.  You just have to say how many cubes it takes.  This one, you're matching the silhouette with front, right, left, or back of this building over here, and Student N and Student A, don’t say tomorrow that I didn’t know what to do with my homework.  Really easy.  Here's what needs to happen.  When we come back from lunch we'll clean up, so leave everything where it is, and show me that you're ready, and I'll call you to get your tickets.",teacher,269,3,1.0,,1.0
