"The cube I was on page 15 was C and it is two by two by one, which is four.  The way that I figured it is by looking at the base and there was two layers of – there’s two layers of two so that I had two [inaudible]",student,50,1,,1.0,
"Okay, so also looked at the base and there’s only two.  And you said there’s only two [inaudible] two.  Who else did C? Did anybody do it in a different way than looking at the base and length?  Which other way did people do this? Anybody did [inaudible] base, too, Student J.",teacher,52,1,1.0,,1.0
"Yeah, I looked at the dimensions and I knew that the width was two and the height was two and the lift was two so I [inaudible]",student,27,1,,0.0,
"Okay.  You used dimension.  The length was two, height two, width two.",teacher,12,2,1.0,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
"Why would you use height, weight and, length?",teacher,8,1,,,1.0
‘Cause using length and height gives you the – helps you find the volume [inaudible],student,15,2,,1.0,
"That’s how you find volume.  Okay.  Who did D?  Okay, Student A.",teacher,12,1,1.0,,1.0
I did D except instead of doing two by two by three; I actually did two by two by four.,student,20,0,,0.0,
Instead of doing two by two by three you accidentally did two by two by four.  Okay.  What was the instruction?  What was – was this supposed to be two by two –,teacher,33,0,1.0,,0.0
By three.,student,2,0,,,
By three?  But you did two by two –,teacher,9,0,,,0.0

I did [inaudible] I did D.,student,6,0,,,
"Speak up, please.",teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
I did – I did K I mean.  And what I did was the volume [inaudible] two by two by two and then two times three times two is eight so –,student,32,1,,0.0,

Two by two by three.  Do you think you did not understand the problem or you made a mistake and you didn’t know how to build it?  What was it?,teacher,30,0,1.0,,0.0
I made a mistake.,student,4,0,,,
In counting?,teacher,2,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Where did you make the mistake?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
"At first I thought this was four.  I don’t know how, but I just looked at it [inaudible] and I was trying to build it on my own without using the book and then I found I made a mistake [inaudible]",student,41,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so you’re saying you did not make this.  Two by two by three.  So what’s the dimension of this one?",teacher,21,1,0.0,,0.0
Twelve.,student,1,0,,,
"Twelve.  And this is D.  Okay, well what do people see is in this two cubes?  What is the relationship that you see here, Student A?",teacher,26,1,,,1.0
Well both – both dimensions start with the number [inaudible] two are repeated [inaudible],student,14,1,,0.0,
Both numbers are what?,teacher,4,0,1.0,,0.0
Repeated twice in the dimension.,student,5,1,,,
Both repeat two by dimensions.  Okay.  Relationship.,teacher,7,1,1.0,,0.0
What I notice is that C is four and D is twelve.  So since it’s -- the dimension for C is two by two by one and the dimension is for D is two by two by three which is – it just looks like it was tripled to get –,student,51,2,,1.0,
[inaudible] say that again.,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
"Okay, so [inaudible] answers.  For C it was four, for D it was twelve so [inaudible] triple to get three [inaudible]",student,21,0,,0.0,
It looks like this was tripled?,teacher,6,0,1.0,,0.0
One was tripled to get three so [inaudible] ‘cause four times three is twelve [inaudible] was tripled.,student,17,0,,1.0,
So you’re saying this is tripled?,teacher,6,0,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, that’s what I’m asking.  D – you’re saying D was tripled. So you tripled the one to get this.",teacher,20,0,,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  C.  Any other relationship that you see?  Student J says C was tripled to get D.  [Inaudible] walk – which of the dimensions was tripled.,teacher,26,1,,,1.0
The one in two time two times one and the –,student,11,0,,0.0,
Is this tripled?,teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
And the height in two --,student,6,0,,,
Is this tripled?,teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
The three is not tripled?  How about this?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
So if this was length and this is –,teacher,9,1,,,0.0
Width. Width.,student,2,0,,,
-- width.  And this is height.,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Height. Yes.,student,2,0,,,
So you can use the other ones to tell me which one was tripled.,teacher,14,0,,,0.0
The height is tripled.,student,4,0,,,
To get what?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
The [inaudible],student,2,0,,,
"So, in other words, Student J did what?",teacher,8,0,,,1.0
She tripled the height. Height.,student,5,0,,,
"Okay, how best can you describe that?",teacher,7,0,0.0,,1.0
"Another way to describe it is by two by two by one will be four and two by two by three would be twelve.  Or it could be is one-third of twelve, so that’s how [inaudible]",student,36,0,,1.0,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
What else?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Another way that it could have been tripled is [inaudible] to turn the height [inaudible] so like triple it [inaudible],student,20,0,,1.0,
So [inaudible] what it is.,teacher,5,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"First layer, second layer –",teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Third.,student,1,0,,,
"[inaudible] layer.  So, the three layers [inaudible] the triple.",teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
So what happens to base?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
The base stayed the same. Still the same.,student,8,0,,0.0,
Still the same.,teacher,3,0,1.0,,0.0
But the height changed because of the layers.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  We’re going to be using a lot of what you did yesterday to approach today’s math class.  So, for today, this is our objectives, what we have to achieve to make sure that this class or this lesson was a success, to make sure that you learn.  First, we’ll find volumes [inaudible] prisms we did it yesterday.  We’re going to do another one using some other numbers, organizing [inaudible] to fit in a rectangular box.  Also, yesterday we used boxes or we used this, remember?",teacher,86,3,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"And we said if this was eight by four by four we double it, right.",teacher,15,0,,,0.0
Uh-huh. Yes.,student,2,0,,,
And this became what?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Eight by five. By four [inaudible],student,6,0,,,
Eight by eight by four.  Is that right?,teacher,8,0,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  So why – how did it change to eight by eight by four? How did it change [inaudible?],teacher,19,0,,,1.0
Because the width was doubled.,student,5,0,,,
Because was the width was doubled.  Was the width doubled?,teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Do you know which one is the width [inaudible]?  The one going up.  Which is the one going up?,teacher,19,0,,,0.0
Length.  Oh.,student,2,1,,,
Which one?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
The height.,student,2,0,,,
"The height is the one going up, right?  Because it is the height that was what?",teacher,16,0,,,0.0
Doubled.,student,1,0,,,
"Doubled.  The length is still the same and the width is what? Still the same.  But the height going up changed.  So, Student F, does that make sense to you?",teacher,30,1,,,1.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
"So, do you not know which one you would double if you have to double this?  So when Student J was saying that what she did was triple – [inaudible]",teacher,30,0,,,0.0
"Yeah, mine is A - C, yeah.",student,7,0,,,
"This is C.  I think that cube was correct.  And what we were saying is make it what?  Three times, right?",teacher,21,1,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"One, two, and three.  [Inaudible] cubes to also do that.  [Long pause]  Yes, Student T?",teacher,15,1,,,0.0
The thing I don’t get about C is that you can put two of these into a [inaudible],student,18,0,,0.0,
So two – two of these will give me – two of these is two C’s.,teacher,16,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Will give me one of A.  How is that?,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Well –,student,2,0,,,
"How is that?  How is it that two – look at – this is C and this is A.  Student T said she noticed so she [inaudible] between A and C.  And what she found is that two C’s will make one A.  What do you see, Student M?",teacher,49,0,,,1.0
I think that two C’s will make one A because the volume of the cube A is eight and the volume of cube C is four and four is half the size of eight so that [inaudible] take two of cube C [inaudible],student,43,5,,1.0,
Okay.  Can you say it another way.,teacher,7,0,0.0,,0.0
In the expression on the board –,student,7,1,,,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
"-- eight goes two times two times two, it’s double from one.",student,12,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  Look [inaudible] sizes too.  Yes, Student J.",teacher,8,0,0.0,,0.0
Another way that two C’s will go into one A is because the dimensions is two by two by one.  So C –,student,23,1,,1.0,
This is two by two.,teacher,5,0,1.0,,0.0
By one.,student,2,0,,,
By one.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
"So, like you add another layer to that A.  So like [inaudible]",student,12,1,,0.0,
One more layer.  Who did [inaudible] the width [inaudible],teacher,9,0,1.0,,0.0
We would put it in – Just put in [inaudible] Just put in a [plat].,student,15,0,,0.0,
So it’s not a layer.  What we increase is what?,teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0

The width.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
The width. [inaudible],student,3,0,,,

We could find the volume of the length times width times height.,student,12,2,,0.0,
"Length times width times height.  So [inaudible] I think we have to achieve today would be find the volume [inaudible] is to fit – to fit in rectangular boxes.  Consider how the dimensions of a box change when the volume is changed. Just what happened here, the dimensions changed.  The volume is changed.  What happened?  So we’re going to do a little bit more of that.  So for that practice we’re going [inaudible] what we did.  You’re going to do this right now.  Can you put those down, please?",teacher,89,7,1.0,,0.0

So what – So we [inaudible] the six in the – in the dimension two by six by four and that’s how we got the ninety-six.,student,26,1,,0.0,
So what about the base of the original?,teacher,8,1,0.0,,1.0
The base of the original was twenty-four and since there was two layers [inaudible] we did twenty-four by two which brought us to forty-eight and here the base is – Twelve. No.  The base is forty-eight and then there’s two layers here [inaudible] forty-eight times two is ninety-six.  So we doubled the six [inaudible],student,54,1,,1.0,
"Okay, is there any other way you could have done that and still have ninety-six.  If you change this dimension –",teacher,21,1,1.0,,1.0
