Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"So what about the one fifth?  You cannot just ignore it because you said that a teacher doesn't have 70 students.  It didn't say a teacher had 70 students.  Think about it. Don't rush.  Student K, what are you doing?  What about this half here?  What about this one fifth?  Oh, I see what you did.  Good.  Oh, you're right, Student M.  50 percent. It's just asking you.  It said what percent of the students take the bus, all right?  What percent of the students take the bus?  Student D, what percent of the students take the bus?",teacher,98,4,,,0.0

"Sorry, because the half equals 50 percent.",student,7,1,,,
"Yes.  It states that a half of her students take the bus.  Very good, and a half is equivalent to 50 percent.  Student A, what?  You're okay?  All right.  You got 50 percent?  50 percent is equal to a half.  So we have established that 50 percent take the bus, then it said one fifth of her students walk.  The rest of her students ride with their parents.  What percent of the students walk?  Let me see yours, Student K.  Write it on your paper.  I'm coming to look at it.  What percent of the students walked?  Very good.  Let me see yours, Student P.  What percent walked? You write 8.  Student S, you have the percent?  What percent of the students walk?  One fifth?  No.  Hold on here.  It said the fraction is one fifth.  So what is one fifth as a percent?  That's what it is asking you for. What is one fifth as a percent?  Convert it to a percent. Where is one fifth?  Good.  Where's yours, Student N?  Let me see yours.  One fifth is equal to 20 percent.",teacher,183,16,1.0,,0.0

"Is this right, Ms. G?",student,5,0,,,
It's not 25 percent.,teacher,4,1,0.0,,0.0
"Because half of her students take the bus, and one fifth of the students walk, so is it 10?",student,19,0,,1.0,
"No.  One fifth – so you have a half of the students which is 50 percent.  Now they're not asking for the total number. They're just asking for the percent, okay?  So 50 percent and 20 percent – 20 percent of her students walked.  Now what's the whole?  What's the percent?",teacher,51,8,1.0,,0.0

"So if we have 70 percent, out of what?  Out of how many percent?  What is the whole?",teacher,18,3,,,1.0

30 percent is left.  Okay.  Now this one was kind of tricky.,teacher,12,1,,,0.0
"Ms. G, I got [inaudible]. I got it.",student,8,0,,0.0,
Nice.  There are [inaudible].  So you're going to find the fraction here.  How many of them walked?  One fifth. There's going to be a remainder.,teacher,25,2,1.0,,0.0

"Excuse me.  Okay.  Now very quickly, let's do this one.  Where did I put my marker?  It's right here.  Now let's do this from the beginning.  Ms. H asked her students how they get to school each day.  She collected their answers and determined the following results.  Half of her students take the bus.  So one fifth of her students walked.  The rest of her students ride with their parents.  Now part A asks you what percent of students take the bus?  What percent is a half?",teacher,87,2,,,0.0

So why are we doing that?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0

"To find the rest.  Now first, we need to find the whole so that we can calculate the fractional portion of the whole, which is the rest.  Now some people did this.  They know that percentage is out of a total of 100.  So out of 100 we already have 50 percent.  Then we have another 20 percent, so 50 plus 20 is equal to 70 percent, so this is the fractional part of the whole.  So what is the whole?",teacher,81,11,,,0.0
100.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"100 percent.  So 100 minus 70 is equal to 30 percent.  Student E, I need your attention.",teacher,17,2,,,0.0

"Now we will continue to review fractions and percent, because this is very big on your end test, and your end-of-year math test is coming up.  Excuse me – and I am sure that you will see a problem with percent and fractions, okay?  Very good.  All right.",teacher,48,4,,,0.0
