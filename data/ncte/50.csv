"- your swim clothes.  Don’t forget, Student reminded me December’s reader letter we have a few more of those left for the group.  Fundraiser calendars, can drive and secret Santa.  Questions about homework?  Okay. So listen carefully to the directions.  What you need out from that – your two homework sheets, just put them up to the corner of your desk and then please take out your black math [boxes].  Put everything else away.  Black math binder, two homework sheets and then you may open up to where you have [craft] paper in your binder. Student, don’t forget your homework paper [inaudible].",teacher,102,0,,,0.0

[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
[Inaudible].  So boys and girls looking up here.  Today what we’re going to work on is we’re going to add fractions using a clock model and in parentheses can someone read what that word is in parentheses?  Rotation.  Okay.  So we’re going to talk a little bit about what rotation on a clock means.  So we’re gonna continue with our work on adding fractions.  I’m gonna put two fractions up here right now and just raise your hand when you have the answer.  Raise your hand when you have the answer. Student?,teacher,92,6,,,0.0
Four-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
How many of you agree with Student that it’s four-sixths?  Okay a lot of hands are going up.  Who can prove why it’s four- sixths?  Student?,teacher,26,0,,,1.0
Because if you have one-sixth to three-sixth it equals like four-sixths.,student,11,0,,1.0,
"You’re right, that’s true but what did Student say this morning when we were talking about fractions?  He remembered something that we had been talking about.  Do you remember Student?",teacher,30,1,1.0,,1.0
When you add a fraction and a double fraction with the one and the three it goes into a four but the denominator stays the same.,student,26,4,,1.0,
Good.  There’s the word I was looking for.  The denominator stay the –,teacher,13,1,1.0,,0.0
Same.,multiple students,1,0,,,
- same.  So in this case all the sixes stay the same.  So that was kind of easy in our head wasn’t it?,teacher,23,0,,,0.0
That’s just like the denominator stays the same it’s just one plus three.,student,13,1,,1.0,
"Yeah, you’re just adding the top.  One plus three in this case. Now, is this in its simplest form?  Could we actually do anything else with this or find an equivalent?  We could?",teacher,33,1,1.0,,0.0
We could divide it by two.,student,6,1,,,
"You want to divide it by two?  Okay, so remember when you divide one by two we have to divide the other.  And four divided by two is?",teacher,28,4,1.0,,0.0
Two.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Two.  Six divided by two is three.  So now it makes two-thirds. So that fraction actually ended working out pretty comfortably because the denominators because the denominators were the?,teacher,29,4,,,0.0
Same.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Same.  Well now you may use your scrap paper if you like, what if I gave you this?  So try to work through that and raise your hand when you think you have an answer.  You may use your scrap paper.  If you’re not sure could you work through it with your pencil and paper? You should be working through it.  Good job.  All right.  I’m not gonna get around to everybody.  Before you give me the answer, those of you with your hands up, what if somebody did this?  What would you tell them if they did this? Student?",teacher,100,0,,,1.0
It’s wrong.,student,2,0,,,
Well it is wrong but why is it wrong?,teacher,9,0,,,1.0
Because you’re not supposed to be adding the denominators –,student,10,1,,1.0,
Exactly.  This is a very common mistake because most people think if I’m adding one plus one I must be able to add two plus –,teacher,26,1,1.0,,0.0
Six.,multiple students,1,0,,,
But we just talked about adding fractions.  Denominators stay what Student?,teacher,11,2,,,0.0
The same.,student,2,0,,,
The same so this is not gonna work.  So before I hear an answer can someone tell me how to start this problem since the denominators aren’t the same?  Student?,teacher,30,1,,,0.0
I would tell you that you [inaudible].,student,7,0,,,
What do you mean finding the equivalent?,teacher,7,1,0.0,,1.0
I mean [the one half].,student,5,0,,,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
So I got 36.,student,4,0,,,
Did anyone else try to find an equivalent fraction here?  I saw some of you boys at this group write down an equivalent. So which denominator did you want to change?,teacher,31,3,,,1.0
The two.,student,2,0,,,
"The two.  How many of you did the half when you changed your fraction? Okay, why do most people go with a half?  Why do most people go with a half?  What do know about halves?",teacher,36,1,,,1.0
Well because like if you try to divide up to six it’s the denominator would change.,student,16,2,,1.0,
Well it would change.  It wouldn’t be the change.  But what do we know about a half?,teacher,17,0,1.0,,0.0
It’s easy.,student,2,0,,,
It’s an easy fraction.  Remember we had our conjectures on our poster and we talked about relating things back to the half?  So how do we turn this half into another fraction that would have a six in the denominator?  Student?,teacher,41,3,,,0.0
Three-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
"Good job.  Three-sixths, three over six.  So I’m just going to cross that out because I now have my new fraction three- sixths.  Now can I add them up and get my final fraction? If I didn’t have it before I could do it now.  Student, what do you think we get?",teacher,52,3,,,0.0
You get four-sixths.,student,3,0,,,
"Very good.  Four-sixths.  Again, is this in its simplest form? What would its simplest form be for four-sixths?  What would it be?  This is kind of a trick question.  You’re gonna see why in a second.  What would it be for [four- sixty]?  Why would I say it might be a trick question? What do you notice up here?  Who’s really looking carefully?  Student?",teacher,64,0,,,1.0
It’s four divided by two.,student,5,1,,,
Well we did.  We did four divided two and six divided by two but I see something else up here.  Student?,teacher,21,2,1.0,,0.0
Because two-thirds is actually four-sixths.,student,5,0,,,
It is.  You guys are right.,teacher,6,0,1.0,,0.0
The one above it [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
Thank you.  What did we just do from here for four-sixths to two-thirds?  Did we just move it over?  So is this the same exact thing?  Did we really have to think about dividing that by two?  We already had the answer right above it.  So that just happened to work out that way.  Student?,teacher,55,0,0.0,,0.0
I did it a different way.  I did it the percent way.  I did it one-half equals 50 percent and one-sixth equals 16 and two- thirds and I put them together and I got 66 and two-thirds which I knew was two-thirds.,student,42,2,,0.0,
"Very good.  Did you hear Student?  So what she started to do was the percent.  And Student you can do that however I think that these fractions are small enough that you could just keep it in the fraction form but that’s not a wrong way.  That’s another way.  So I like that too. Okay, so let’s move on.  I want to start talking now about the clock.  So I was saying today we’re gonna talk about fractions on a clock.  Does anyone remember from fourth grade talking about fractions on a clock?  Does it seem familiar?",teacher,97,5,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"How about brand new to some of you?  Who has this as their brand new, first time seeing the clock for fractions? Okay.  A little bit mixed.  So if we take a clock, I have a clock up here and we all know that clocks have how many hands?",teacher,49,1,,,0.0
Two.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Two.  Okay.  So I’m gonna show you a clock that’s similar but this clock doesn’t have any hands for a reason because we’re gonna put our own hands in.  So let’s think right now if we’re focused right now just looking at the hours on the clock, we’re gonna pretend the minute hand is broken. We’re just gonna use the hour hand.  So if I look at this clock what is our whole here?  Student?  When your looking hours do we have 60 hours on a clock?  So what do you think?  How many?",teacher,94,1,,,1.0
Twelve.,student,1,0,,,
"You’re right.  Twelve.  So our whole is 12 because we all know if we move all the way around the clock we have 12 hours. So there’s our rotation.  We know what clockwise is.  So when we’re dealing with hours our whole is 12.  Okay, now let’s switch it and pretend the opposite.  Bless you.  We now broke our hour hand and our minute hand is working. What is our whole now?  Could it also be twelve?  What do you think it is Student?     Sixty.  Is that what you were thinking of because minutes are out of what?  Sixty.  We know there’s sixty minutes in a?",teacher,106,3,,,0.0
Hour.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Hour.  So that should be pretty comfortable.  So let’s go back to the hour one right now.  We know that 12 is our whole. And here’s our middle of the clock point.  If I started at the 12 and I moved from 12:00 to 1:00 so this piece, what would I have for a fraction?  So if I moved from 12:00 to 1:00 with our hour what would I have for a fraction?  Talk in your groups. All right, what is it Student?",teacher,83,3,,,0.0
It would be one-twelfth.,student,4,0,,,
How many of you think it would be one-twelfth?  Very good. Right because we only went one piece around the clock.  So what happens if I did this?  Talk in your groups.  What would it become if I moved over another number? Student?,teacher,43,0,,,1.0
Two-twelfths.,student,1,0,,,
Two-twelfths.  It’s that easy right?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
And if I have two-twelfths some of you were thinking what does two-twelfths reduce to?  One-sixth.  So we could even say that this whole section in here is one sixth.  Yes Student?,teacher,32,1,,,0.0

Speak up.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Sixty minutes in one hour and 12 hours in – that’s [inaudible],student,12,0,,0.0,

I was saying [inaudible] one hour and two hours.,student,9,0,,0.0,

Minutes but what are they broken down into?  Who remembers?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,

Five.,student,1,0,,,
Five.  So Student when we go in minutes we’re gonna start counting by?,teacher,13,0,,,0.0
Five.,student,1,0,,,
"Five till we get to 60.  So let’s go back to the hours right now.  So right now we’re talking about hours.  We have twelfths because there’s 12 hours on the clock correct? All right. Let’s do a different example.  What if I now take my clock, I’m s till on hours, Student still on the hours, and I want to start on 12:00 and I want to go all the way to 3:00.  I want you to think of two fractions for this one.  What if I go all the way to 3:00?  Two fractions.  You looking girls? That’s one of them.  What else?  Thinking about hours.  Who would like to come up and write one of the fractions up here?  Why don’t we try the obvious one first?  Student come on up.  The obvious.  That’s not the obvious.  That’s the reduced right?  Thank you.  How many of you got three- twelfths as one of your fractions?  So I say the obvious because we were talking about twelfths and we did one- twelfth, we did two-twelfth, so this kind of led us into three-twelfths.  So Student put three-twelfths.  But what else do you notice about this whole piece?  You could do it mathematically or you could see something else looking at it visually.  Do you want to come up Student and write the other one? Okay anyone else find one-fourth besides Student?  Who can explain why it’s one-fourth?  Good job Student.  Student?",teacher,243,5,,,0.0
Because if you do three-twelfths divided by three it equals one- fourth.,student,12,1,,1.0,
So you’re using division?  Why is she using 12?  Why is she using 12 when she divides?  Student?,teacher,18,2,0.0,,1.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
Because we know that the whole is 12.  Very good.  Twelve divided by – what did we land on?,teacher,19,2,,,0.0

Let’s try it.  Did it work?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Is it correct when we say the section is one-fourth?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Of course it is.  So you could have reduced it using a number. What number would have got it to one-fourth?  What could we have divided by?  What could we have divided by?,teacher,33,2,,,1.0
Three.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Three.  Three divided three is one.  Twelve divided by three is?  Four.  So you could have worked it out mathematically or you could have seen that this is four or one-fourth of the pieces that you’ve got the whole which is 12.  So Student thank you for bringing that in because look it, haven't we been using multiplication and division in fractions?  Yes.  I like how a lot of you are nodding.  We have. And if we went back to the first example I gave where I just went to the one, when I just went to the one and I told you it was one-twelfth.  How could we make that into a division problem?  Student?",teacher,116,7,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,

If you put one-fourth plus one half how would you –,student,11,0,,0.0,
So you’re thinking ahead.  We’re gonna get to that.  You’re staring to add up a lot of things.  We could keep one- fourth and add a half to it but let’s wait till we get there. Are we ready to look at minutes now?  What do you think?,teacher,48,2,1.0,,1.0

Does everyone understand hours or our 12? What did we say minutes are out of?,teacher,15,0,,,0.0

No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Talk in your groups.  What is that gonna be now if we’re gonna be doing minutes? So my question was is it still three-twelfths? All right.  Let’s bring it back together.  Who thinks they have the correct fraction?  Remember these are minutes now. We’re on minutes.  Student?,teacher,47,1,,,0.0

Denominator.,student,1,1,,,
Denominator.  Excellent.  Okay.  So what if I wanted to show a half on this clock?  What would I do?  Why don’t I have someone come up and show it?  What would you need to continue to shade in?  Student come on up.  Student you should be in your seat. Very good.  We can clearly see that Student has now shaded a half of the clock or we could also call it what?  Not just a half but?  Two-fourths right?  Because weren’t these broken into fourths?  Good job Student. What else could we call this for fraction?  I’m actually going the opposite way.  I’m going bigger.  Let’s take it out of those minutes again.  If we’re over on the six what would it be?  What would it be?,teacher,127,2,,,0.0

[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
Thirty.  You were close weren’t you?  Thirty over sixty and then we would probably reduce it back to the half.  So we kind of worked backwards on that one. Student hat should be away right now.  Put it away.  Off to the side.,teacher,43,0,,,0.0
Every fourth and 15 minutes –,student,6,0,,,
"Oh good observation.  Did you hear Student?  Every time we move a fourth we have 15 minutes.  Doesn’t that make sense?

The hour or it lands back on the twelve.  I know why you said that.  Right?  Okay. So boys and girls we’re gonna actually try to do a few of these on our own.

Boys and girls if you have finished and you’ve found two fractions for each box you may try reducing them to the simplest form. Okay, why don’t we come back together?  I want all eyes.
