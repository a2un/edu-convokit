Fractions.  And can someone tell me more specifically what about fractions we’ve been doing?  Student E?,teacher,16,2,,,1.0
Common denominators?,student,2,1,,,
"Common denominators, what does that mean?  What does the word common mean?",teacher,12,1,,,1.0
The same.,student,2,0,,,
The same.  So the same denominator.  Why would we ever want to make fractions have the same denominator?  How does that help us?,teacher,23,3,,,1.0

"We’re adding fractions.  Right.  Like one of the reasons we added fractions the other day was to get to a whole.  So we’re gonna start there today. Boys and girls, I’m gonna stop you right here.  I realize that you think it’s funny that we’re on video.  But this is not how you act on a regular day.  And it’s not gonna be how you represent our school on a video.

We’re gonna start with what Student J said, adding.  And Student D said.  And we’re gonna use what Student E said, using common denominators to add to one whole. So, the other day when you were using your fraction circles, I was asking you different ways to add to make one whole.  Could someone tell me an example of fractions that add to one whole using the same denominator?",teacher,95,11,,,1.0

A half plus a half.  Anyone notice anything that these two examples from Student J and Student A have in common?  What do they have in common?  Student S?,teacher,29,0,1.0,,1.0
Eight sixteenths is equal to half .,student,7,0,,,

"So, Student S, you must have read my mind ‘cause that was the next thing we were gonna do.  I was gonna say let’s use our knowledge of equivalent fractions to instead of adding with just the same denominator, what could we substitute for one of these?  So, Student J, you knew what that said – that could tell you that one third plus four sixths would be a whole.  What did you know already?",teacher,75,3,,,1.0
I knew two thirds equals four sixths.,student,7,0,,,

"Okay.  ‘Cause if you put eight eighths is one whole and if you subtract six eighths from that, it leaves two eighths.",student,22,2,,1.0,
"Yes.  So eight eighths is the whole she had.  Guys, we’re gonna be late for recess ‘cause I’m gonna stop and I’m gonna wait until everybody is listening to the explanation.  Because after lunch you’re gonna play this on your own.",teacher,41,1,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible] ask questions about the [Inaudible].,student,6,0,,,
"So, Student L actually got ten tenths.  She knows that’s a whole.  So she didn’t have any blocks on zero to be able to move a whole hypothetically since I switched ‘em on her. So we decided to move six eighths.  We know that since eight eighths is a whole we have to move another two eighths.  We have two eighths left over but we’ve already used up all our eighths so we need a new equivalent.  So instead of moving two eighths, what’s an equivalent for two eighths that we could move?  What’s an equivalent – What’s an equivalent for two eighths?  Student E?",teacher,105,8,0.0,,0.0
Two fourths.,student,2,0,,,
Two fourths is equivalent to two eighths on your fraction track?  They’re on the same spot?  So look at your fraction track at two eighths and go up and down.,teacher,30,3,,,0.0
Oh!  One fourth.,student,3,0,,,
"One fourth.  So, I could, or Student L actually could, go to our fourth track and move from one fourth to two fourths.",teacher,23,0,,,0.0

"I’m showing how to play.  If you were really playing the game you would already know that but we’re not ready yet.  So, she moved.  Does everybody see how our equations are now gonna help us?",teacher,36,1,0.0,,0.0
This is complicated.,student,3,0,,,
She moved six eighths.  She moved six eighths plus one fourth and that equals one whole.,teacher,16,1,,,0.0
I get it now.,student,4,0,,,
"You gotta try to get one whole and you can break it up and use different fraction tracks, different number lines.  But your total that you move has to be whatever card you picked and she picked one whole.  So you may think one whole’s easy but if you don’t have any cubes on zero, then it’s not.  You have to break it up.  Okay? So we’re gonna play this after lunch and we’ll do a couple more practice rounds.  So when I call your name you may get your coat and line up at the door.  Student J?
