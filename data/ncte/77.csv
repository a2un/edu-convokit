I agree.,student,2,0,,,
Why do you agree with him?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0
Because the whole is eight and there's only one half shaded in.,student,12,1,,1.0,
So half of it is shaded in?  How do you know it's half of them are shaded in?,teacher,18,0,1.0,,1.0
Because one's colored and one's not.,student,6,0,,,
One side is colored in?  Okay.  Anybody see any kind of relationship between the numbers four and eight?  Student J?,teacher,20,0,1.0,,1.0

I agree.,student,2,0,,,
Okay.  Why do you agree with him?,teacher,7,0,,,1.0
"Because there's eight pieces, and eight are shaded in, so then there's no more pieces left, so that goes in to a whole.",student,23,1,,1.0,

One quarter.,student,2,1,,,
"We talked about this from the other day.  We can call this one fourth or one quarter.  It's just a different name for the same fraction, but that’s good.  It's a fourth or a quarter, but we would write it the same way.  Good.  I like that.  Yes sir?",teacher,49,3,,,0.0
One third.,student,2,0,,,
So this one here?  Do you have another name for that?,teacher,11,0,,,0.0
Yes.  Two sixths.,student,3,0,,,
Can you explain to me how that's the same as two sixths?,teacher,12,0,,,1.0
"Because if you take one sixth and you put it under the piece that's shaded in the one third, and you add another one, it's going to get [inaudible].",student,29,1,,1.0,
"Okay.  I can see this one.  We didn't do anything to it, but you can see that one half of it is filled in, so you can call that one half.  We didn't do anything new to this one, but we can say that the whole thing is filled up.  We didn't do anything new to this one, but we can say the whole thing is filled up.  I would have to do something to that one, and it wouldn't be one third anymore, would it?",teacher,86,2,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,

No.,student,1,0,,,

Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"I hope so because you guys were third graders not that long ago.  If you were going to explain what equivalent fractions mean to a 3rd grader, how would you explain it to them?  I want you to talk about it in your group for just a couple of minutes, how you would explain to a 3rd grader what it means to be an equivalent fraction.  You don't need those yet.  Box is up here.  The reason you can't come and get your work is you didn't bring in your permission slip, so you can't go in front of the camera.  We're going to be filming again, and next time you guys can sit in your normal places as long as you bring in your permission slips.  Yeah, you can still raise your hand.  We just can't see you on the camera.",teacher,142,2,,,0.0
"If we were supposed to explain would it be equivalent fractions, or fractions?",student,13,2,,0.0,

My favorite number?,student,3,0,,,

"I'll say – I'm going to do it for that one up there, the last one.",student,16,0,,0.0,
Which one?  They all have names.,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
Four eighths?,student,2,0,,,
What's that?  Four eighths and one half?  So how would you explain to a 3rd grader what it means to be equivalent fractions?,teacher,23,1,,,1.0
"I'll say that an equivalent fraction is one fraction can be named another type of fraction too, like four eighths can also be one half because it's four eighths – I mean four is half of eight, and it's eight in all, and there's four colored in, so it's like a whole [inaudible].",student,53,4,,1.0,
"That would explain this fraction, why these are equivalent fractions, but how could you explain to a 3rd grader how any fractions are equivalent fractions?  Because these guys aren't the same as there are, are they?",teacher,36,4,1.0,,1.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So how would you explain to a 3rd grader what it means to be equivalent fractions?  Student C, what did your group talk about?",teacher,24,1,,,1.0
We talked about—,student,3,0,,,
I thought you were going to say we talked about.,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
"We talked about [inaudible], like eight eighths.  Like, if it's a whole, we can call it one whole.",student,18,2,,0.0,
But I don't hear two different fractions being talked about.,teacher,10,1,1.0,,0.0
"Eight eighths is the same thing as three thirds, because it's all colored in, and it makes one whole.",student,19,1,,1.0,
"Okay, so that explains why this one, these two fractions have the same name, but how would you explain how any two fractions, or more than two fractions, are called equivalent fractions?  How could you explain that to a third grader?  Student D?",teacher,43,4,1.0,,1.0
"Because you have two shapes, and one is shaded in fully, and one is half, so it's going to be like, one and one half.",student,25,0,,1.0,
"This doesn't sound like equivalent fractions.  Remember, we said that four eighths and one half are equivalent fractions, that three thirds and one whole are equivalent fractions.  Eight eighths and one whole are equivalent fractions, so what does it mean when something's an equivalent fraction?  Yes sir?",teacher,47,7,0.0,,1.0
"It's like when you have any fraction, and [inaudible], and there's a half, or a whole, or anything, you could say it's the same to another fraction.",student,27,3,,1.0,
But how do you know two fractions are equivalent?  What shows you that?  Student E?,teacher,15,2,1.0,,1.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
You just raised your hand.  Is that your question?  How do you know that two fractions are equivalent?,teacher,18,2,,,1.0
"Because if you do four eighths, and one half, if you were to draw one half, it would have both sides shaded in, and then four eighths is one side.",student,30,0,,1.0,
"I'm thinking that equivalent fractions both have the same area filled in.  In this fraction, is half of four eighths filled in?  That's why we know the area of this one is the same thing as if we made a half.  I know that the area of this one is the same thing as if we just didn't have any lines here and it was a whole.  Would that be the same thing?",teacher,73,7,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"So equivalent fractions are when fractions have the same area, they cover the same area.  Yes sir?",teacher,17,4,,,0.0
Wouldn't equivalent be the same?,student,5,1,,,
"Yes, yes.  So the same area of four eighths is colored in as if we drew a one half.  The same area of eight eighths is colored in as if we just had one whole, and there was no lines in here at all.  Make sense?",teacher,46,4,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  We're going to move on to some other stuff in a few moments, but what I want you to think about for just a few moments, is when we were making fractions the other day, and we had those ones with 24 on them, how did we know how many square units there would be, say, if we made an eighth?  How did we know how many square units there would be if I had one that was 24?  What was the dimensions?  Yes sir?",teacher,86,6,,,0.0

We're going to be using the blocks in a second.  I like how nobody has opened up the boxes yet of blocks.  Student K, you've got a couple more boxes there.

One of you guys can take a chair over here.  There's another chair. You don't have to bring them.  You can just scoot up to there as well.  One of you guys have learned what you're supposed to do; the other hasn't quite figured it out yet. So what you're going to do is you're going to each need 24 blocks.  That's it.  Guys, there's too many of you over there.  Why don't one of you come over here, or over there? So each person is going to need to have 24 blocks.  Let's try to do that as quickly as possible.  Don't worry about the colors.  Just get it done.  You can get up.  You get up, and you go over here, and you go, ""Oh.  Here's some blocks.""  That's all you do.  It's really easy.  Make sure they're not hooked together.  Make an array of 4 by 6 really quickly to make sure you have the right amount. Make sure they're not hooked together.  You seem to be hooking them together.

Somebody over here decided they had to take only blue and whites.  That's why they're really slow.  Okay.  So what I'd like you to do, and you can definitely talk to your neighbors about this.  I want you to kind of make sure you only have 24.  I see some on the floor.  You don't want to have any extras.  Okay.  What I'd like you to do is kind of act out this story using the blocks.  Remember what we were doing right here when we had to find out how much a half is, how much a third is, how much a fourth is, how much a sixth is, how much an eighth is, how much a twelfth is.  I want you to kind of act out that story.  Are these extras? Keep it the way you had it.  Look at the way Student B did the one fourth, and look at the way Student V did the one fourths.
