"All right.  Okay.  Today we are going to work on volume, but before we get to volume, I'd like to tell you that you're going to have a box.  You're going to work in pairs. You're going to have a box to work on and find out how many of this – this is a cubic centimeter, or a centimeter cube, right?  You're going to find out how many of these cubic centimeters that I have in my hands here, that you need to fill up this box.  Now you've got to come up with strategies to do it, right?",teacher,100,6,,,0.0

Now because you don't have – we don't have enough. We don't have enough cubes for everybody, see?  Now we've got to come up with our own strategy.  I'm going to give you some of these.  I'm going to give you a box, and each pair is going to get a box, and this is the box you're going to get.  The two of you here, you're going to get this.",teacher,107,4,,,0.0
