"Excellent.  That is one strategy adding up.  It is very similar to using a number line.  It's the same, actually.

I love that you all used landmark numbers and multiples of 10 to make this easier which is our goal today.  Use multiples of 10 and 100 to find the difference between any three digit number and 1,000.  It's a lot easier to add by groups of 10, multiples of 10 than ones, just any number.

What do you mean the up and down way?  You used the standard algorithm?  And did you do addition or subtraction?,teacher,21,3,1.0,,1.0

[I think he did three ways] but something similar.  632 plus 68 equals 700.,student,14,0,,0.0,
"So you combined the ones and the ten.  If you feel comfortable enough with your numbers that you can do that in your head instead of adding 632 plus 8 to get to 640.  They combined, Student K and Student N, the 8 and the 60 and did 632 – girls.  632 plus 68 and jumped all the way to 700 first. So that cut down one step.  If you feel comfortable with that, Student K, you can do it.  If not, just go to the nearest multiple of 10.  I don't care which way.  It is slightly more efficient to jump to the 100.

"Good.  Good job with miles, too.  368 miles.  Excellent.  This is almost the same as this – what we did in the beginning. It is very important.  Student J.  I need all eyes up here. Pencils should be down.  You shouldn't be playing with anything.  Your head shouldn't be on the desk.  You should be sitting up with your eyes up here.  This is the same jumps, the same landmark numbers as Student D's way.  It's just a different way to illustrate it.  If it makes more sense to you on a number line, that's great.  Was I not clear?  If it makes more sense as a list of equations, that takes up a lot of space.  I don't care right now.  Whatever makes the most sense for you?  I want you understand what you're doing.  Now one other way that we are going to solve this right now is using subtraction.  I know Student A used subtraction with the standard algorithm which we're not gonna talk about yet.  Did anyone use subtraction a different way not using the standard algorithm?  Student J, I know you did.  Student K, you did too.

We're gonna do a whole unit of subtraction next week or the following week.  And we will introduce that.  It's definitely a strategy to use. We just like to show a lot of different strategies so you understand what you're doing versus following a series of steps.  And whatever feels the best, whatever makes the most sense to you, you can then use.  All I want you to do is understand what you're doing and know how to do it. Anyone have a question about this before I erase it?  And since my overhead is still broken, we will only use this board today.

If you ever don't, you made a mistake.  Maybe the first time, maybe the second.  That's why it's so important to check your work.  Use another strategy 'cause if you use the same strategy you often make the same mistake.  If you try something different, you realize that either, yes, you probably have it right.  Or you did something wrong.  And then you can fix it.  Good.  368 miles.  And here the answer is here.  We are not adding anything up.  We subtracted 632 in parts from 1,000.  We kept the 1,000 whole.  It is very important to do that. Sometimes kids, when you're doing subtraction, break up both numbers.",teacher,146,3,,,0.0

"If you wanted to, you could be on the 700's page with 632.  Add up and then count the pages to get to 1,000.  But no one did.  Page 9 is a continuation of how many miles to 1,000. We have just reviewed four different strategies for finding the difference between – girls, when this says what's the difference between 632 and 1,000, it's asking you to either subtract 1,000 minus 632 or 632 plus what gets you 1,000. The difference is a clue word for subtraction.  That was another thing I noticed when we took the test we took.  One of the many tests that we took.  The question said what was the difference between this answer and this answer?  And people were commenting like this answer was bigger.  Or this answer had three digits and the other one only had two.  It meant what was the actual difference in the numbers, so you'd subtract or add up to find that difference.  Right now, you are going to work on page 9. It says all different examples of how far you've travelled when you're trying to travel to 1,000.  The back, if you flip it over, it says you have travelled blank miles.  How many more miles to 1,000?  I'm gonna get you a set of digit cards.  On the back.  You're doing the front first.  You will draw three cards.  Whatever three cards you drew, that's gonna make – you're gonna use those three digits to make a three digit number.  So guess what, if you draw a 0, I don't want that in the hundreds spot 'cause then it's a two digit number.",teacher,276,11,,,0.0
