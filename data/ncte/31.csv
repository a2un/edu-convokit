"So, on your desks you have the multiplication cluster problem that you worked on this weekend for homework, right? And we started this on Friday, I gave you a little introduction and we did Set A together, and you got to work on Set B, is that true, before we left class on Friday?",teacher,54,1,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Who can talk to us about what multiplication cluster problems are? What are they all about? What is the purpose of multiplication cluster problems? So when I look at each set, I see several problems, and then a final.  So I see like three or four problems and a final problem.  What’s the purpose of the cluster problems, Student C?",teacher,60,2,,,1.0
Maybe to help us learn the multiplication part of the [inaudible].,student,11,1,,0.0,
"To help you to know the product of the final one? Can somebody add to what Student C said? So she thinks that they have something to do with the final multiplication problem in the list.  Student L, do you want to add to that?",teacher,45,4,1.0,,1.0
[Inaudible] to help you with the [inaudible].,student,7,0,,,
"And did you find it to be helpful with [inaudible] over the weekend? So was there something from the list that you could choose to help you solve the final problem at the bottom? Raise your hand if you felt there were some helpful ones in the list.  Okay, so you’re getting kind of [inaudible] problem at the bottom of the list, and those related problems, those clusters, those clusters are there to help you break down your problem.   And in past experience, we had to create our own problems.  Right? We had to make arrays and break those large problems down on our own and be creative to think about how to do that.  But in this case, you don’t necessarily have to be as creative because they give us a list of problems to choose from.  So that was pretty helpful, wasn’t it? Okay. So we did Set A together, but I want to show you an example of something that you’ll be working on this morning.  You’re going to take these sets and take them a little bit further in a little bit of a project with a partner.  So here is my example.  I’ve chosen Set A, we already solved A together on Friday, so what you’re going to do is here’s your list of directions.  I’m going to give you and a partner a slip, and on the slip is one of the sets on your sheet.  The only one that’s not represented is A because I’m doing A for you, so I took A out of the possibilities.  So you might get Set B, C, all the way to F, if you don’t know which set you’re going to get.  That’s why I asked you to be prepared over the weekend to come in with them all finished.  You’re just going to add a little bit of work to that set, okay? So, with the set that I give you, you are going to solve each of the small [inaudible] problems in the picture, which you already have, if you did all your homework.  So all you have to do is rewrite them on a slip of paper.  So you solve all the smaller ones, okay? Then you’re going to decide upon one or two problems to use to help you solve the problem more challenging problem, one or two, okay? You might choose one and then have to add something to your own thinking.  Or they might be two in the list that will help you get right to the product of the final problem. I keep using the word product.  Can someone remind me what the word product means? Student E?",teacher,449,6,1.0,,0.0
The answer to the problem.,student,5,0,,,
"Yes, so the answer to a multiplication problem is called the product.  So solve each of the smaller problems, decide which ones will help you to find the answer of the large one.  Then, this is new.  You want to draw an open array that matches what you chose.  So whatever problems you chose to help you solve the final problem you’re going to draw an open array to help you visualize what this problem breaks down to look at, okay? What is an open array? Student N?",teacher,88,5,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"It doesn’t have all the square units, so we won’t bother with every single small square unit in the box.  That helps us with smaller multiplication problems, but when we get into the hundreds we would spend a long time drawing all those small boxes.  So with the open array you don’t have to do that, right, Student M? Okay. So here is an example of what this will look like.  After you draw you’re array you’re going to write a short little description of how you solved the final problem and why you used the problems that you used.  So what were you thinking about when you chose each of the problems? How did you come to decide on those particular problems? Because Student M, you might work with Student C, and each of you are going to have the same set, but you might want to use two problems and Student M might want to use another two problems because he sees math in a different way.  He’s making sense of the breaking down of problems a little bit different. Is that okay to do?",teacher,187,8,,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"So if you’re working with a partner on the same set, is it okay if you each choose a different way to solve the problem? What do you think, Student B?",teacher,31,0,,,1.0

Do you have to use the same problems that your partner uses?,teacher,12,0,,,0.0

"Are you with me? Pay attention, pay attention.  Who can answer my question?",teacher,13,0,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,,,1.0
Because the two of us may think a different way.,student,10,0,,0.0,
"So even though you have the support of your partner, and you can work together and help each other, Student C, you might decide that you want to use the first two problems and Student E, if you happen to be with him, you might decide you want to use the third problem or make up your own second problem, that’s perfectly fine.  You’re just there to support each other, you don’t have to have the exact same ones.  Okay? Because you each have your own way of thinking about these.  And you each already thought about them for homework anyway.  So it’s up to you how you come to that conclusion of what to use.  [Inaudible], deciding on which problems to use, open array, short description of your thinking, why you did what you did and how you got to the final answer, okay? And then you’re going to put it all together on a little sheet that looks something like this.",teacher,163,1,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Similar.  Exactly.  So you’re going to do it on the slip that I gave you, do the solving.  This is where you write your little explanation, and your open array can go down here. You can mix it up a little bit, if it doesn’t all go on the same exact spot that’s fine with me, as long as you have those components.  The answers to the small problem, the description of how you solved it and why you did it that way, and your open array with the dimensions.  What are the dimensions of an open array? What do I mean by that?",teacher,104,5,,,1.0
Sideways and…,student,2,0,,,
"So the number that goes on the side of the array and the number that would go on the top of the array, right? And one of those numbers will most likely be broken apart into smaller pieces, okay? So this is a small version to show you what yours will look like, and then I just made kind of a gigantic version so you could see.  So I did Set A, 4 x 10 is 40.  4 x 40 is 160.  4 x 3 is 12.  And 2 x 43 is 86. The final problem is [inaudible] .43.  So what made sense for me when I was figuring out what to use to solve this, was 4 x 40 and 4 x 3.  Is this the only way I could have done it? No, but it was my first thought.  It was the first thought I had.  And the reason for that is, I know that 4 x 40 and 4 x 3 gives me 4 x 43.  Because I took the 43 and I broke it into two smaller parts.  I broke it into a 40 and a …",teacher,191,2,,,0.0

"You will have a final project.  We may or may not finish this today, we got started a little bit late with the camera issue, but if we don’t finish it today we’ll finish it up tomorrow.  But you should be able to get a significant amount of work done on it today.  Okay? And are there any questions? Okay, so I’m picking partners.  When I pick your partners I want you to come to me and I’m going to give you each a slip.  There’s no [gluing], there’s no final product until these are solved and the work is in your notebook. When all is that is finished and you checked it all over and you’re sure that it represents what you want it to say or to be, then you can have it checked with me and I’ll just be walking around and helping you out.  You might end up sitting at other people's desks and that’s fine of me. Just please be thoughtful of their belongings, don’t touch things that don’t belong to you, but we’ve got to be working at desks.  So whatever partner you get with, you need to find a desk to work at.  Okay? Clear? And like I already said, your partner is your partner for math, you’re not getting married, so it doesn’t matter who you’re working with.  Use them for the best ability that they have, right?
