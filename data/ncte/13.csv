"Cameras are on.  It’s 11:30, December 13.  This is Math class. So, recording in progress. Okay, let me have your attention please, boys and girls, put the books away and get your folder ready and your notebook, as well as your box.  So last week we’ve been exploring volume, right, and volume of a rectangular prism.  So can someone just tell us or remind us how we found the volume of this box, or this rectangular prism?",teacher,77,7,,,0.0
You multiply the length by the width by the height.,student,10,2,,0.0,
"Okay, so we figured out one way to do this was to multiply…",teacher,13,1,1.0,,0.0
The length…,student,2,1,,,
The length.,teacher,2,1,,,0.0
The width.,student,2,0,,,
"The width, and then the height.  Okay, so that was one way to find, right, and we all tried that.  Is there another way to find this, Student D?",teacher,29,0,,,1.0
The bottom of the surface times the height.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"The bottom of the surface here you said? Okay, so surface, for example, this one has 5 across and 4 this way, so what does that mean? The surface has 20 squares.  And if you were to put cubes, you can put 20 cubes, right? The bottom layer. And why do you multiply by 3, Student D?",teacher,57,4,1.0,,1.0
Because that’s the height.,student,4,0,,,
"Because that’s the height, that’s the 3 layers, right? So if you were to take apart the 3 layers, then you have 3 layers of cube. Any other ways that we tried or you tried? No? Okay.  So last time you made this box, and this is Box 1, and we did volume, and I would say everyone did very well on the test on Friday in terms of finding volume.  I don’t think anyone had a problem finding volume.  Maybe there are a couple of problems with other things, being careless, for example, the pattern, that you miscalculated, then something else, just being careless.  But in terms of volume, I think you had no problem doing that. So today we are going to shift into something, not volume, but similar.  I shouldn't say similar to volume, but something that we can use this box to find, to help us to start. And that is called a surface area.  So today we’re going to explore finding the surface area of an object, of a rectangular prism.  I’m just going to write this word.  And please write this down in your notebook. Okay, so write down surface area, and what does that look like to you, the words “surface area”? What does that sound like? What do you think it means? Student A?",teacher,222,17,,,0.0
The surface of the area,student,5,1,,,
"So the surface, like this board has a surface, the floor has a surface, but what about area? What’s area? Student S?",teacher,22,2,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
So area is the number of…,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible],multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, you remember this, right?",teacher,5,0,,,0.0
From last year.,student,3,0,,,
"So area, that’s the number of square units, right? Of an area. For example, this floor, you can count the number of squares, the number of tiles.  This board, if we put the grid here, then you can also count the number of squares. So does that have to do with the inside? Does that have to do with cubes? If we’re just looking at the surface?",teacher,67,7,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"Think about it.  We’re looking at surface.  Why did you say no, Student L?",teacher,14,0,,,1.0
"Because it’s not finding the whole thing, it’s just finding the surface.",student,12,1,,1.0,
"Okay, it’s not the whole prism, but it’s just the surface.  So for example, if you just look at the surface of this, how many squares do you see at the bottom of your box?",teacher,35,3,1.0,,0.0
24.,student,1,0,,,
"There are 24 squares, right? Because it’s 6 x 4. And what about the surface of the bottom of this box? How many squares do you see?",teacher,27,2,,,0.0
24.,multiple students,1,0,,,
And they’re the same?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"These are the same.  So can I say that they have the same surface, or the area are the same? Now, but if you look at the two boxes, do they hold the same number of cubes?",teacher,37,2,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So can I say that the volume is different, okay? This one versus this one.  But what about the surface? Just the bottom.  We’re just looking at the bottom.  The same, right? So area is the same but volume is different.  So if we look at surface, are we looking at the inside, how many cubes it can fit in here?",teacher,61,4,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, we’re just looking at the surface. So for example this paper has a surface and you can see the number of squares here, right? Okay? But if I turn it this way, suppose you can look at the paper as flat from this angle, do you see any? If this is two-dimensional, you’re not supposed to see any height, right? But it has a surface, but there’s no volume.  And last week I think we said that volume has to do with what kind of objects?",teacher,87,5,,,0.0
Three-dimensional. Three-dimensional solids.,student,3,2,,,
"Three-dimensional solids, right? So I want you to remember this, boys and girls, and as we find the area or the surface, we’re not going to think about the volume, okay? [Interruption] So what was I saying? Okay, when we look at the surface area, we’re not going to think about volume, okay? So what you’re going to do is to create a box that looks like this, but this time I am going to give you a grid that looks like this instead of the pattern.  You will have to figure out the pattern for making this, and you just draw it and cut it out and make a box the size of this, all right? And this is the same as the first one that you made last week before you added. Now, after that, pay attention please, after that you’re actually going to use this as a cover.  And this is a box, so you cover this box and now it’s a rectangular prism, right? Okay.  So again, we’re not looking at volume, so not the inside, but only on the outside, the surface, okay? Let me just help you start by looking at one of the sides.  So let’s say the box is like this, Student S, let’s say this is the top.  I just call it the top, and that’s the bottom, sides, front, back, okay? How can we find the surface or the area of this top side? Student J?",teacher,246,10,,,0.0
Measure length and width.,student,4,2,,,
"Length, okay, that’s 6 units.  And then 4 units this way.  So how many?",teacher,14,3,,,0.0
24 units.,student,2,1,,,
"There are 24 not just units, but square units.  So 6 times 4 square units.  Okay, does that make sense? So now we took care of the top.  How many sides are there in a rectangular prism? How many different sides?",teacher,41,7,,,0.0
6.,student,1,0,,,
"6, right? Top, bottom, 1, 2, front, back, 3, 4, side, side, 5, 6.  Okay? So what you’re going to do is you’ll make this box first and then I want you to write… Figure out the area of the top and then the area of the bottom, the area of the front side, area of the backside, the side, one of the sides, and then the other side, okay? So once we have all six of those, what does that mean? We have found all the surfaces, right? All the sides.  And then how do you find the surface area of this entire rectangular prism?",teacher,106,8,,,1.0
You add them up?,student,4,1,,,
"You just add everything up and then you have the total surface area of this.  So why don’t I have you start by making the top.  This is pattern for Box 1. Can you walk around the other way instead of walking this way? Thank you. Okay, does everyone have one? You need one more? So use a pencil to make the pattern and then you cut, okay? Yes? There’s one more right there, yes. Okay, so make sure you count carefully. Student J, do you know what to do? Can you stop for a minute, Student J? So how many squares across? How many units? If you count from here, how many?",teacher,113,6,,,0.0
4 square units.,student,3,2,,,
"4, right? Square units.  How about this way? Here to here? Is it also 4 square units?",teacher,17,4,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"So is this going to match? You need to make a pattern that’s this size, right? And only one layer.  One unit high, okay? All right, very good.  Very good.  Are you all set, Student J? Okay. Why are you making another one, Student L?",teacher,45,1,,,1.0
Because I messed it up.,student,5,0,,,
"So here you just cut the corner, is that right?",teacher,10,0,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"That’s fine, you can do another one. What are you looking for?",teacher,12,0,,,0.0
Tape.,student,1,0,,,
"Just tape the top and you don’t have to tape the lid, the cover.  Just tape the sides so you can cover this, like a box, okay? Okay, now that’s the same as this, okay? Boys, how do you think we can find the area? Remember we talked about this? Or the surface area of this whole rectangular prism?",teacher,59,6,,,0.0
"You find all the areas, like this part, this part, this part and this part and this part and you add them up together.",student,24,2,,0.0,
"Okay, do you agree with that, Student S?  The area.",teacher,10,1,1.0,,0.0
"That does not work.  If you add this and that, these share. No, you add this 20 plus 24 plus 18…",student,21,2,,0.0,
"Okay, Student S, can you say that again? What do you mean they share?",teacher,14,0,1.0,,1.0
"Because right here, if you put the cube in, this square and this square are the same squares.",student,18,4,,1.0,
"They’re part of the same cube, so we can’t count them twice. But remember what we said? Are we working with cubes or are we not doing cubes any more, and this time, Student S, it’s just the surface, okay.  Just the surface.  So this has nothing to do with that, because we’re not doing cubes, okay, just the squares.  In other words, how many squares are there all around this, okay? So remember surface area. Area is just the surface, not the inside, okay? So that’s a good point.  Do you understand?",teacher,93,9,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, so can you start calculating and write in your notebook just like the way I wrote on the board? So once you have your box, boys and girls, you can start figuring out the surface area of this box.  The entire box.  It’s just like counting all the squares around this box, so that’s the number of squares, area. Here, Student G, tell me about this? How did you figure these out?",teacher,73,5,,,1.0
So the top area I found by the bottom because it’s the same.,student,13,1,,1.0,
"You’re saying the top area is the same as the bottom area, okay.",teacher,13,2,1.0,,0.0
"And the front, this here, and the back are the same.",student,11,0,,0.0,
"Okay, where’s the front.  So 3 units by 4 units, show me.  Mm- hmm, go ahead, so they are 12 square units, right? The front and the …",teacher,28,4,1.0,,0.0
Back.,student,1,0,,,
Are the same.  Then what about the last two?,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
"The sides, they’re also the same.",student,6,0,,,
"Right, okay.  So that’s why you did it twice.  Okay.  And how do you find the total number of squares around this rectangular prism?",teacher,24,4,0.0,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Mm-hmm, and then you have the… Total surface area, very good. Okay what are you working on?",teacher,17,3,,,0.0
[I had to re-do it.],student,5,0,,,
Oh.  So just quickly fix it and then you can start looking for the area.,teacher,15,1,0.0,,0.0
This is not going to fit on the box.,student,9,0,,0.0,

You [inaudible].,student,2,0,,,
"Remember, we have to look for the surface area, that means all these sides all together, right? So what do you have to do? Can you figure out the area of this side? How about the area of this? So what does that make?",teacher,44,4,,,1.0
The area around the box.,student,5,1,,,
"Yes, so how do you find the total surface area?",teacher,10,3,1.0,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Well, you can do this way, you can do this.  So once you have all 6 then what do you do?",teacher,21,0,,,1.0
Add them up.,student,3,1,,,
"Okay, so let’s see that in your notebook.  Let’s put this aside and why don’t we start writing. Okay boys and girls, I need to see that in your notebook, so you need to write down surface area.  Student L, put this book away. Where’s the surface area?",teacher,48,4,,,0.0

And why?,teacher,2,0,,,1.0
"Because it says, you have to [inaudible] one surface, you’re doing [inaudible] surface.",student,13,0,,1.0,
"Okay, so once you found six surfaces, you just add them, right? And that’s exactly what Student M just said, is that right? Very good. Okay, now if you were looking at this box like this, so where’s the top?",teacher,40,1,1.0,,0.0
Over here.,student,2,0,,,
"This is the top, bottom, front, back, side, and side.  Can you see that? There are six sides.  But you can also look at it from this angle. So can this be the front?",teacher,34,1,,,0.0

I counted all the squares.,student,5,1,,,
"Oh, you counted all the squares.  You counted each one of these? Okay.     That works, because you’re looking for the surface of this whole thing, right? But what I’d like you to do is to take this box like one side of a time.  So you calculate the area of this side, this side, this side, this side.  And then what do you do at the end?",teacher,67,3,1.0,,0.0
Add them all together.,student,4,1,,,
"And then you have the total surface area.  Okay, just like the way I wrote on the board.  You see the red? Let’s see.  Okay, very good.  All right. Okay, another minute, boys and girls.  Take another minute to finish, and if you’re done, I’d like you to write down – okay, listening please – to write down how you can calculate or find a surface area of a rectangular prism, okay? So if you were to explain to someone who does not know how to find the surface area, what would you say? Just write it down, okay? And make sure you have the right units. Okay, let me have you stop for a minute, boys and girls. I think most of you have found the area of all the sides, so how can we find the area, the surface area, or the area to all of these sides around this rectangular prism?

So for this one, first of all I’m going to have you find the volume, and then you’ll find the surface area, okay? So this is a rectangular prism.  Okay, wait a minute, Student S, let’s leave that up because I want people to be able to see that.  Okay, so this rectangular prism is 4 by 3 by 2 inches. Okay, so draw in your notebook.  I want you to draw the prism, and then I want you to find the volume.  Okay, we’ve been practicing finding volume, right? And then the surface area. What are the dimensions for this box, Student M?

"Okay, why did you do those twice? Each one twice?",teacher,10,0,1.0,,1.0
"Because I put each side, like right here.  You still find the same answer, because each side is the same on the other side.  This side and the back side, the top and the bottom.",student,35,0,,1.0,
"Okay, very good.  So you noticed the front and the back and the top and the bottom, those are the same. And instead of finding it two times, you just find once, and then multiply by 2.  Very good.  Maybe you can try to write a formula. Okay, those people who finished, see if you can write a formula for finding a surface area.  See if there’s an easier way to do that instead of doing 6 steps and then add, is there an easier way? Do you see a pattern, any patterns?",teacher,93,4,1.0,,0.0
I can make it into 3 steps.,student,7,0,,,
And how is that? How does that work?,teacher,8,0,1.0,,1.0
"Because this is the same on the other side, so you can do 4 times 2 times 2, but that’s only 3 steps.",student,23,0,,1.0,
"So you don’t have to repeat that because it … okay, very good. Can you write a formula, just write it down. What do you notice about these numbers?",teacher,29,0,0.0,,1.0
"They’re the same, right? And so are these, see? So how can you write a formula, if you can write a formula to find surface area.  Something that’s easier than doing one side at a time.  Think about it.   Yes? [0:53:00] You could do top times … top plus the front plus the right times 2.",student,56,2,,0.0,
So top area plus front area plus right area times 2? Why times 2?,teacher,14,3,1.0,,1.0
Because it’s [inaudible] so you can times 2 it.,student,9,0,,1.0,
"Oh, very good.  Can you write it? Just write the whole formula. Surface area equals… Length times height times width, remember what that … we did that last week, right? So what’s that? What would that be if you multiply…",teacher,40,5,0.0,,0.0
52 square units.,student,3,2,,,
"That would be the volume, but we’re not looking for volume, right? You found the volume, now we’re looking for surface area.",teacher,22,5,,,0.0
"I figured out an easier way.  If the top area is 6 x 4, you don’t have to do the bottom because it’s going to be the same.  So it goes both sides, front and back, and then left and right.",student,41,1,,1.0,
"Okay, so if you only find one of them and then double, multiply 2, then you find.  Okay, very good.",teacher,20,1,0.0,,0.0
"Because it’s going to be the same, the ones over here and the other sides.",student,15,0,,1.0,
