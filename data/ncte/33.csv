"Okay, so we have been working with mostly these larger numbers, and so today we are going to aim to solve this final problem, 13 x 8.  How we’re going to do that is we’re going to work in clusters.  So clusters are a few sets of number equations that are related, but they’re not really related to each other.  Because is 3 x 8 related to 13 x 4?",teacher,70,1,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"Not really.  But both of these equations are related to our final problem.  You are going to be solving multiplication clusters after we do this activity.  So we’re going to do it together as a class with this example, then you’re going to go back to your seats or your groups, your partners, and you’re going to work together to solve your own sets, and then you’re going to make a poster.  So that’s the whole big picture.  And we’re going to figure out how to solve this equation. What’s 13 x 2, Student M?",teacher,95,4,,,0.0

13 x 4? Student K?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0

"What’s a way you could solve this in your head quickly? What’s one of the strategies we’ve been using, or you’ve used in third grade maybe? What could you do?",teacher,30,0,,,1.0
Skip count.,student,2,0,,,
"That’s a great suggestion.  You could skip count.  So Student K or A, skip count in your head.",teacher,18,0,,,0.0

"24, good girl.  And then we have this one, 12 x 8.  Student F?",teacher,14,0,,,0.0
98?,student,1,0,,,
"96.  So now what we have are these four equations solved. They’re our clusters.  So how can we use these clusters, each one of these, to help us solve 13 x 8? We could use them as what, Student L?",teacher,40,1,,,1.0
You could double 13 x 4.,student,6,0,,,
"13 x 4, we could double it, why?",teacher,8,0,1.0,,1.0
Because 4 + 4 = 8.,student,6,0,,,
"4 + 4 = 8.  Good job.  So 13 x 4, we can start with that, add another 13 x 4, and we know that equals …",teacher,27,1,1.0,,0.0
52.,student,1,0,,,
52.  52 + 52 is?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
104.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"104.   So that’s one way, we can use this to double, that’s an awesome job noticing that 4 is half of 8, or 8 is double of 4.  What’s another starter you could use, Student B?",teacher,36,0,,,0.0
"12 x 8, and then you have to add one more 8.",student,12,1,,0.0,
Why? Why do you have to add one more 8?,teacher,10,1,1.0,,1.0
Because it’s 12 x 8 and if you add one more 8 it will turn into 13 x 8.,student,19,1,,1.0,
So 96 plus 8 equals…,teacher,5,0,0.0,,0.0
104.,student,1,0,,,
"How could you use one of the other starters, Student J?",teacher,11,0,,,0.0
"Since the number’s 13 x 8, the 3 is already [Inaudible] so you just do 10 x 8.",student,18,0,,1.0,
"You just do 10 x 8, because 3 + 10 is?",teacher,11,0,1.0,,0.0
13.,student,1,0,,,
And what’s 10 x 8?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
80.,multiple students,1,0,,,
80 + 24 = 104.,student,5,0,,,
"How could I use this one? Now remember, before you say your next thing, it doesn’t always have to be two steps.  It can be more than two steps.",teacher,29,0,0.0,,0.0
13 x 4.,student,3,0,,,

[Inaudible] doubles.,student,2,0,,,
It’s a double.  So all you have to do is do 26 + 26 and you’d get 52.  But are we there yet?,teacher,23,0,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No, so what do you need to do? So we’ve done 13 x 4, 13 x 2, we need to do another one, Student A.",teacher,25,0,,,0.0

Do another 13 x 2 = 26.  And we know 26 plus 26 equals what?,teacher,15,0,,,0.0
52.,student,1,0,,,
And 52 plus 52 equals?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
104.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So what is our answer? 13 x 8 equals what?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
104.,student,1,0,,,
"104.   So when you go back and work on your own, you’re going to solve just what’s in blue for each one.  But then in your poster, you’re going to choose one of these solutions to solve 13 x 8.  So which one do you want to choose?",teacher,48,1,,,0.0
12 x 8.,multiple students,3,0,,,
"Let’s choose 3 x 8, okay? So you’re going to have on your poster at the top, you’re going to have a final problem just like I have here.  And then you’re going to use one of your strategies.  So we’re going to do 3 x 8 equals…  Can you see, Student G? When I do this, can you see?",teacher,60,0,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No, so why don’t you move back.   3 x 8 equals what, Student G?",teacher,14,0,,,0.0
3 x 8 = 24.,student,5,0,,,
"Equals 24.  What’s the next step we have to do, Student R?",teacher,12,0,1.0,,0.0
10 x 8.,student,3,0,,,
10 x 8 equals…,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
80.,student,1,0,,,
24 plus 80 equals…,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
104.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So you’re going to do this.  And then remember when we were doing large equations and we used parentheses? We’re going to do that again.  So you’re also going to need 13 x 8 = 3 x 8 + 10 x 8.  That’s 24 + 80.  So you’re going to write your big equation.  And then, Student J, you’re going to draw it out as an array.  How many can draw this out as an array? If I have 8 and 13, I have to do what to it? What do I have to do to make this up here, here?",teacher,101,5,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Well, yeah, I need to make two different arrays.  We don’t need to do all the little squares, because that’s going to take us way too long.  But what can I do to make 3 and 10 appear on here? Student R, do you want to help her?",teacher,48,2,,,0.0
You’re going to cut threes [inaudible].,student,6,0,,,
"Yes, you’re going to cut it.  So you’re going to go across like this, up here is my 10, down here is my 3.  8 x 10…",teacher,27,0,1.0,,0.0
80.,multiple students,1,0,,,
8 x 3.  Are there any questions on how to do this?,teacher,12,0,,,1.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So what we’re giving you, when you go back to your seats and you pull out page 57 and 58, they give you the four ways to start it.  You’re going to choose one way to start, and solve it on your poster.   There are six sets.  There’s Set A, B, C, D, E and F.  There are six sets.  We have nine groups, so there can be some repeats.  So when I call you back to your seats you’re going to whip out page 57 and 58, and then I’m going to tell you which set you’re going to work on.  Yes, Student A?",teacher,105,0,,,0.0
Are we going to work with our partners?,student,8,0,,0.0,
"You’re going to work with your partners.  So, Student A, you and Student J are going to work on Set A on page 57.  Go back to your seats, take out page 57.  Student N and Student G, you’re going to work on Set B on page 57.  Rip it all the way out.   Student F and M, you are going to work on Set C.  Remember to scoot the furniture.

"Student R, [inaudible] not in the behavior right now.  So I’m going to ask that you and Student K go back to Table 1 and work separately over there. Let’s see what you’ve got for me? So now you have 32 x 8 equals… Now, are you going to have two sets of parentheses? So you do 32 times [inaudible] plus 32 times 2.  Is that 32 x 8? No, so you’re going to need to [inaudible].  And then your array.  [inaudible] Use these to break up your array, just like I broke up the array 4 x 43.  And then when you guys finish that, you can go on to do Set D on the back. Now yours, perfect.  630 plus 63.  Can you do it using the equations? 63 x 11 equals… So what is [inaudible]?",teacher,138,5,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Don’t forget to break up your array.  This is 63 and this is 11, how did you break it up? Oh my goodness, there’s so much going on here. We’re going to have five more minutes to work on these, because we’re going to have our conduct celebration at 2:00.",teacher,50,1,,,0.0

That took us way, way, way too long to get settled. When you made your posters, I’m very interested that they’re done neatly, but some of you are letting the colors of your markers go crazy.  So from now on, two colors and that’s it.",teacher,77,0,0.0,,0.0
I only did one.,student,4,0,,,
"Two or one.  One is better.   I don’t have a hundred colors going on.  It distracts you, and then you leave some out, and poor Student M, thank you for cleaning all those up. So now let’s wrap this up. Who had Set A, raise your hands.  Perfect.  You’re each going to take a turn presenting.  So Student K and Student S, present your poster.
