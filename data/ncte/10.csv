Student C, can you go get the two black markers that are on my desk please? And flip!  Pass the quizzes to your right, then pass them back. Student N, you can leave them on the table with the tablecloth, okay?  We are going to take our unit test for this unit this week sometime.  Girls?  Put those away! Either probably Wednesday we’ll take our end of unit assessment on this unit.  Today we are going to review a whole bunch of things we’ve been working on for the past month or so.  Student C, put that away. First we’re gonna review the homework over the weekend.  We are gonna review some old questions that are similar to the test word problems.  Then we are going to work on multiplication and division word problems.  Okay?  Obviously we’re gonna solve some of our own and then you are gonna work on creating your own. The first thing I want to do is go over the homework though.  So please turn to the first page, which is the multiplication clusters.  Page 58 I think; 57 we did in class and you had to finish 58 for homework. Student Z?  Did you hand it in?  I would pass back all the homework. Look in your – well the people that finished it in class put it in their folder.  They didn’t hand it in.  If for some reason you don’t have it, you need to take out your math notebook and take all these notes.  You need to write down every cluster. Student N?",teacher,292,8,,,0.0

Remember, in multiplication clusters, there’s a series of problems to help you solve the final problem.  You might use all of them.  You might use one of them.  You might use two of them.  They’re just supposed to be easy problems that you can solve really quickly and they will somehow help you solve the harder problem at the end.

I did [Inaudible].,student,3,0,,,
"So you added 60 times 11 to 3 times 11.  And so, if we wanted to write how we were writing them when we were practicing that, you could say 63 times 11 equals 60 times 11 plus 3 times 11.  And then you have your 60 groups of 11, 3 more groups of 11 to equal 63 groups of 11 – 660 plus 33 equals 693.  Correct?",teacher,68,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,

"I did 63 times 10 equals 630 and then 63 to that equals [Inaudible] and then I got, I got 693.",student,21,0,,0.0,

Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  So 63 times 11 would equal 693.  So she started with the 63 times 10 and added one more group of 63.  If you were representing an array, representing this equation with an array, this is not gonna be drawn to scale in any way ‘cause I’m not a good artist.  But, if you wanted to do what Student K did, you would have the 11 here, the 63 here, and she split it way over on the side so it’s 60 by 3, right?  This is 11 times 60 and this is 11 times 3.

300.,student,1,0,,,
"Good.  And you could do that because you could know 5 times 6 is 30.  So 50 times 6 is 300.  Also, you’re doubling 25 times 6, so you can double that answer, okay? Student K, do you have a question?",teacher,41,0,,,0.0

"As the problem.  Nice observation Student C.  Do you remember last week I taught you and I showed you the array.  If you double one number and cut the other number in half, you’re gonna come up with an equal equation or expression. So, in 25 times 12, if you double the 25, you get 50 and if you take half of the 12, you get 6.  So 50 times 6 should equal the same thing as 25 times 12 and does it?",teacher,83,3,1.0,,0.0

I did 10 times 12 two times to get and then I did 5 times 12 which is 60 and add them up.,student,23,1,,0.0,
"Okay.  Does everybody see what she did? She did 10 times 12 twice to get the 20, and then 5 times 12 to get the five more.  So 120 plus 120 plus 60 equals 300.  And that array – you guys see this part?  That array – this dimension would be 12 and then the 25 is like 10, 10 and 5. So you just broke the 25 into 10, 10 and 5.  So you would get 120, 120 and 60.  Okay?  Questions? I really – if you do not understand something, please ask.  We are taking the assessment sometime this week; probably Wednesday.  So, if you’re confused about one of these ways, you need to ask for help.  You don’t have to understand every single way we’ve explained, but make sure you feel strongly and comfortable using one of the strategies. Student D.",teacher,144,3,1.0,,0.0

Put your legs the right way under the desk and pay attention!  And Student Z, if we wanted it to be an array, one side’s 5 and one side’s 76, but it’s like we split the 76 to 70 and 6.

Remind me to take it down from there when I roll this up.  You have the total, you have the number of groups and the number in each group. In multiplication word problems, you are given the number of groups and the number in each group always, right?  I have 7 baskets; there are 25 apples in each basket.

In division you’re given the total and then one of these two things and you’re looking for the other one.  So, if I said  I have 200 people – the total – that need to fit into vans, 8 people can go in each van; I’m giving you the number in each group – 8 people go in each van, right?  We’d be then looking for the number of groups or the number of vans.  I hope your eyes are up here.

I could have said I have 15 vans; how many people will go in each van?  Then I’d be looking for the number in each group.

"But also, this would make more sense if you said something like on the baking sheet, ‘cause why would you put cookies in columns and rows, right?  But you know how when you cook them on a baking sheet?  Well say that then.",teacher,43,0,,,1.0
That’s how my mom – oh!,student,6,0,,,
So you could say I have 5 rows – or you don’t even have to write column.  You could say I have 5 rows of cookies. There are 12 or 20 cookies in each row.  Okay?  The first one.  You don’t have a second one yet. What are you guys doing?  No what are you talking about?,teacher,57,0,0.0,,0.0

"That could have been.  I wish that that’s what you were talking about.  Mm hm.  Okay.  Boys and girls, raise your hand if you have finished writing and solving your first problem. Listen please boys.  Your hands should be up.  Okay.  Raise your hand if you solved Student D and Student M’s problem. Hm.  And raise your hand if you wrote a second problem for yourself.  You know what I might do?  I would like you – I’m going to type these problems up and you are going to solve them for homework.  I’m gonna type them during lunch. So, it’s time for math to end.  I would like you to leave your notebooks open onto the page where the problem is and I’d like you to pass the problems to your right so the last person in each row has a notebook that’s open.  Okay? Tonight for homework you are going to solve your classmates’ problems.  Everything else you can put away and we are going to stop.",teacher,169,0,1.0,,0.0
