Sandra and Tyler made two loaves of bread.  On Monday they ate one half of a loaf.  On Tuesday they ate one third of a loaf.  How much bread was left?,student,31,0,,0.0,
"Thank you.  So, I drew the two loaves of bread.  What I realized on Tuesday was we’ve done a lot of talking about fractions.  We’ve done a lot of talking about [Inaudible] fractions.  We’ve done a lot of talking about fraction [graphs], but for some reason we are not able to take all of that and put it together and then add the fractions together.  So I wanted to talk about that before we got into our small groups. So, [Inaudible], please.  So I drew the two loaves of bread.  We’re assuming the two loaves of bread are the same size.

[Inaudible] denominators the same.,student,4,1,,,
We need to figure out a way to make the denominators the same. So we’re gonna find what kind of fractions?  It starts with an “e”.,teacher,26,2,,,0.0
Equivalent.,student,1,1,,,
"Raise your hand.  Equivalent fractions.  When we’re finding equivalent fractions, you want to think about these two wholes.  Is there a denominator – hold on a second until I finish my [Inaudible].  Is there a denominator that they could have in common? And we can do that a couple of different ways.  We can use the clock. We can say can we make half [Inaudible] clock?",teacher,66,5,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Yes.  Could we make a third out of the clock?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
So we know that they can both have a denominator of what? Raise your hand.  Student R?,teacher,17,1,,,0.0
Six?,student,1,0,,,
But because it’s a clock what would they have a denominator of?,teacher,12,1,,,1.0
Twelve.,student,1,0,,,
"Twelve.  They can both have a denominator of 12 but Student R’s right, they can also both have a denominator of six.  Why can they both have a denominator of six?  Student J?",teacher,33,3,,,1.0
Because half of six is three and one third and half can be divided into six and you can take half.,student,21,1,,1.0,
So half can be divided into six pieces.  Say again what you were saying about thirds.,teacher,16,1,1.0,,1.0
One third can be divided into six pieces.,student,8,1,,0.0,
"One third can be divided into six pieces.  So, if we look at these two loaves of bread, if I cut – well, how would I have to cut the first to make it into six?  How would I have to cut the thirds to make it into sixths?  Student J?",teacher,51,1,1.0,,1.0

"Three or half.  So three sixths?

These can both also have a denominator of six because two and three have a what in common?",teacher,59,3,,,0.0

Multiple.  Why?,teacher,2,1,,,1.0
Because I’m not sure if [Inaudible] because two is a factor of six and three is a factor of six.,student,20,0,,1.0,
"Right.  So if I [Inaudible] by both two and three, I’m going to get to six.  True?  Okay.  So they have a common multiple. And so when we find a common denominator what we’re really doing is finding a common multiple. So, now that we have one half plus one third which is equivalent to three sixths plus two sixths, can we add the three sixths plus two sixths now?",teacher,70,5,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Why can we add ‘em?  Why can we add them, Student L?",teacher,12,2,,,1.0
Because the denominator is the same.,student,6,1,,,

"If I add three-sixths plus two-sixths, what am I gonna get?",teacher,11,1,,,0.0
Five sixths.,student,2,0,,,
Five sixths.  Why don’t we add the denominators?  Why do I have five twelfths?  Student J?,teacher,16,2,,,1.0

I'm making more pieces.  And how many pieces did I start with?,teacher,12,0,1.0,,0.0
Six.,multiple students,1,0,,,

Two.,student,1,0,,,
"Two, because there’s –",teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Because there’s two loaves of bread.,student,6,0,,,
Because there’s two loaves of bread.  Good job.  So the whole is two.  So we can do two.  Someone said minus the five sixths.,teacher,24,1,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Because that’s what they ate.  So that might be hard.  Can we talk about that two for a second in terms of sixths?  What is one loaf of bread in terms of sixths?  What is one loaf of bread in terms of sixths?,teacher,43,0,,,0.0
Six sixths.,student,2,0,,,
"So this is six sixths.  The whole thing is six sixths.  What is this one by itself?  In terms of sixths?  This one.  If I ate the whole thing, how much would I have eaten?  Six sixths.

Six.,student,1,0,,,
"One whole.  And so then if I took a whole away which would give me how many wholes to start?  Two.  So, twelve sixths minus five sixths, can we subtract that?",teacher,31,4,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Why?  Student D?,teacher,3,0,,,1.0

"Because I feel like on Tuesday when we met in our small groups a lot of people couldn’t figure out common denominators and wanted to go to a clock.   Wanted to go – but if you look at three and two, you know right away they both have six. Right?   Without having to draw our clock?  Okay. So what we’re gonna do today is similar to what we did on – [Inaudible] did you do it a different way?",teacher,79,1,,,1.0
I did.,student,2,0,,,
How did you do it?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
"What I did was since they ate five sixths, I knew there were two loaves of bread, so then there was one whole left so the other one has to be one and they have to be [almost] six or get to two so [Inaudible].",student,45,1,,0.0,
"Can I kind of rephrase that and you can tell me if this is what you’re saying?  I think a lot of people thought this way. You’re starting with five sixths, almost like adding on the number line.  And I think what Student T is saying is she knew it took one more six to get to a whole and then it was another whole to get to two.  For an answer of one and one sixth.",teacher,77,3,1.0,,0.0
That’s exactly what I did.,student,5,0,,,
"Right.  Because you can almost picture in your mind, okay, well if they ate five sixths of the loaf I can see there’s one sixth left.  But then they have the whole rest of the other whole entire loaf of bread.",teacher,41,2,0.0,,0.0
Which is two.,student,3,0,,,
"Which brought us to the two.  We’re gonna – I want to do what we did on Tuesday.
