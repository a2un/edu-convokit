"All right, cool. So first I will explain some of the tools that we're going to use. We'll practice using them and then I'll explain a little bit about what it'll be like when we're working together. Sound good? Sounds great. Okay, so can you see my arrow moving around? Yep. I think I can see yours too. Yep, perfect. There are tools over here on the left-hand side. Okay. Oh, I can press these. You see them? Mm-hmm. All right, so the pencil, whenever you click on it, right above it, there's a color and a size bar that pops up. Oh, I see. So if you want to change your color or size for anything that we're writing or drawing, you can do it there. And then the T in the center of a box, if you click that, it will allow you to add a text box if you prefer to type. Okay. And then we're gonna practice erasing. So whatever you do, don't hit the trash can button. Okay. If you hit that button, it erases all of your beautiful thinking and there's no way for us to get it back.",Tutor,195,1,,,0.0
"Oh, so then like if I want to erase something, do I press the X? So that's",Student,17,0,,0.0,
"what we're gonna practice. So draw something with the pencil. Okay, I'll draw a little heart. Beautiful. Then you have to select what you want to erase first. And so this top arrow is your select arrow. Make sure that's highlighted. Click on whatever it is you want to erase. Mm-hmm. And then you hit the X, the arrow, yeah, there you go. Gotcha, okay. Cool? Yeah. All right. And then you can close your chat box if it's open. Okay, yeah, let me do that. Okay, we will, that way it makes your screen bigger. Mm-hmm. And we'll be talking back and forth like this. Okay. And I will ask you lots of questions. Okay. But just because I ask you a question doesn't mean you did something wrong or I want to know a specific answer. I just want to know as much as I can about your thinking. Okay. And on that note, you know how sometimes you're thinking quietly inside your head? Yeah. The more you can say those things out loud, even if they're not fully formed thoughts, the better. It really helps me understand how you're thinking about something. Okay, I'll practice that. Even if it's like, um, I'm not sure what she's talking about right now. Say those things. And then if you, if I ask you something and you're like, oh, not sure, I need some time to think about that, just verbalize that you need time so that I don't interrupt your thinking by asking or talking more. Okay, I got you. Cool. Are you ready to get started? Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna change the page. Do you see something different now? Yeah, I see the map. Yeah. So take a minute to read it and look it over and then explain to me what you think is happening in this situation. Okay.",Tutor,312,0,1.0,,0.0
"Um, it looks like, um, like the lines are the, what's it called? What's the word? It's the, oh my gosh, it's on the tip of my tongue. It's kind of like the path that the driver took to get to Newark. Point to what you're talking about there. What",Student,50,1,,0.0,
"do you see? Oh, um, these. Okay. So yeah, that's the I-95, the interstate. Mm-hmm. Okay. Cool. What are some things that you think we might be able to",Tutor,29,0,1.0,,0.0
"measure in this situation? Um, things we'll be able to measure. Oh, sorry. Sorry, give me one second. Sorry. Um, no worries. Oh, oopsies. No, okay. Something we'd be able to measure? I mean,",Student,34,3,,0.0,
"like, like accurately? Just anything that might be happening in a situation that we",Tutor,14,0,1.0,,0.0
"could think about measuring. Mm-hmm. I want to say, like, how far Providence is from New York City, but like, that wouldn't be accurate. So what you're saying is, if we",Student,31,1,,0.0,
"had some more information, we could find how far New York City is from Providence. Yeah. Yeah? Cool. So what would we be measuring there? What is that thing that we would be measuring? The distance. Yeah. So what are some units we could use to measure the",Tutor,48,5,1.0,,0.0
"distance? Um, we could do, like, how many hours it is away, how many miles it takes. Yeah, those are the main ones that come to mind. Okay, cool. Is there anything else you can think",Student,36,1,,0.0,
"of that we might be able to measure? Not sure. Cool, and it's totally okay and beautiful to say that at any point, too. Okay? Okay. All right, now I'm going to uncover something, and I want you to think about how it was similar or different to what you were thinking about. Okay. Oh, that's what I said. Say more. So you're saying that it's",Tutor,66,1,1.0,,0.0
"similar to what you were thinking? Yeah. Explain more. Um, like, with what I said, like, how many hours it's away and how many miles it takes to get there. Okay.",Student,31,0,,0.0,
"So looking at the map and the graph, explain what is happening during each stage of this journey.",Tutor,18,1,1.0,,1.0
"What is happening? Um, on the graph, it says that they were able to drive 50 miles in one hour from point A to point B, and then, um, they were still only able to drive 50 miles in, um, an hour and a half from point B to point C, and then from point C to point D. That's about, that's 100 miles in, like, almost two and a half hours. And then, what do the squiggly lines mean?",Student,80,2,,0.0,
"Oh, great question. Yeah. Think about that for a minute. What do you think those squiggly lines",Tutor,17,1,1.0,,1.0
"might mean? Um, traffic. Okay. Why do you think it's traffic? Because right here, it's, like, street, and it kind of looks like easy driving and stuff, and then it's here, so it's like, oh, there was an interruption in the drive. Well, I'm gonna, I want to know a little bit more about",Student,54,0,,0.0,
"that. What makes something an easy drive, and what makes something an interruption in your mind?",Tutor,16,0,1.0,,0.0
"Because it's, like, straight, so it's like, oh, um, like, comparing these two, like, this is straight, so it's like, oh, like, nothing really was stopping the driver, and they were just, like, they just kept going. But here, it looks like the driver was being stopped by something, and there was an interruption in the, in the trip. Okay. So you've been pointing to this blue line.",Student,68,1,,0.0,
Mm-hmm. Is this blue line representing distance or time or something else?,Tutor,12,2,1.0,,0.0
"Um, I feel like, hmm, let me think about that one. Cool. Time or distance? I feel like the blue line represents the distance, kind of. not the distance kinda.",Student,30,4,,0.0,
What are you thinking?,Tutor,4,0,0.0,,1.0
I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. I'm not very sure.,Student,13,0,,0.0,
"Okay. So your brain is saying, all right, there's distance and time here in this situation. The blue line has something to do, you've described, like a, did you say easy drive? Or an interrupted drive? Yeah. Yeah, like the straight lines was like an easy drive.",Tutor,47,3,0.0,,0.0
"And then the little squigglies, like, oh, there was an interruption or turbulence in the drive, kind of. Cool thinking. All right.",Student,22,0,,0.0,
"So we're going to dig a little bit deeper into that and try to make sense of what is this thing that the blue line is keeping track of. Okay? All right. So on the map, there's no letters. But there's some letters on the graph. Yeah. Where do you think those letters on the graph would be located on the map? And you can use your drawing tool or your text tool, whatever makes sense for you to label.",Tutor,80,3,0.0,,0.0
I could just like point at it and stuff. I think that's easiest for me.,Student,15,0,,0.0,
Okay.,Tutor,1,0,0.0,,0.0
"So I feel like Providence was like right here, because that's a starting point. And then.",Student,16,0,,0.0,
So just you're saying then this point would be point A?,Tutor,11,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
Okay.,Tutor,1,0,,,0.0
And then 50 miles. I don't know. Point B. Because it took four hours. How many hours did it take to get there?,Student,23,0,,0.0,
How could you figure that out?,Tutor,6,0,0.0,,1.0
"I think. Let me see. I think it took four hours, and this is where it like. And point F is like when it's at. When the person reaches Newark.",Student,30,0,,0.0,
Point F would be here?,Tutor,5,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
And I saw what you did with your pointer. Were you reading that four hours is right here? Yeah.,Tutor,19,0,,,0.0
"Cool. Okay. And then point E. Point E is right here, because it's straight. And over here is like squiggly and stuff. It kind of looks like this if it was enlarged.",Student,32,0,,0.0,
Okay. So you're thinking the point E is here? Yeah. Is that because this little tail of the road looks like this little tail right here?,Tutor,26,0,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
So you're saying that this squiggly part is kind of like this squiggly line where?,Tutor,15,1,,,1.0
"Yeah, like right over here-ish.",Student,5,0,,,
"Okay. So I'm going to have you think for a minute and make some predictions, and then point to where you want to label points B, C, and D.",Tutor,29,0,0.0,,0.0
Okay.,Student,1,0,,,
Okay. Okay. What are you trying to sort through in your head?,Tutor,12,0,,,1.0
"I'm trying to sort through where the straight points would be, because I don't think they would be, like, all the way up here. So I'm like maybe the whole theory with, like, all of this being this part was wrong. I'm trying to figure out what would be right.",Student,50,1,,0.0,
"So you're trying to find, because A to B is straight on the graph, you're trying to find a straight part on the map?",Tutor,24,1,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
To connect that?,Tutor,3,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
"Okay. Cool. That really helps me understand how you're making sense of this. I'm going to type some words up here. Okay. And I'm going to type them in purple. We're going to call these our purple power words. So as I ask you questions, I want you to challenge yourself to use these purple power words as much as possible. Okay? Yeah. Okay. So first we're going to look at just distance. And from A to B, describe to me what is happening with distance.",Tutor,86,2,,,0.0
It's staying the same.,Student,4,0,,,
And say it in a complete sentence.,Tutor,7,0,,,0.0
"Oh, my gosh. Not staying the same. I mean, the distance is increasing from zero to 50.",Student,17,1,,0.0,
Cool. I'm going to write that up here. So from A to B.,Tutor,13,0,0.0,,0.0
What did you say again?,Student,5,0,,,
"There's an increase in distance. In distance. Anything else you want to say about it? Are you happy with this? I'm happy with that. Okay. So from A to B, there is an increase in distance. Now, what's going on with this thing? What's going on with this thing?",Tutor,49,3,0.0,,1.0
What's happening from A to B? Sorry. The time. There's an increase in.,Student,13,0,,0.0,
"So from A to B, there's an increase in distance. And an increase in time. Yeah. Okay. So if I'm on this map. And you said that we're taking the journey and we're starting in Providence and we're driving down this path or interstate. Yeah. And we end up in Newark. From A to B. If I'm going to. I'm going to go to A. Okay. So point B has to be at a place where there isn't. To show an increase in distance and an increase in time. So what it makes sense for B to be located over here. No, no. That's got to show an increase in the journey. Okay.",Tutor,113,2,1.0,,0.0
So take your best guess of where you think point B could be located on the map. Okay. I think point B.,Student,22,0,,0.0,
Would be.,Tutor,2,0,0.0,,0.0
Around the right here. Okay. Why do you want it to go there? Because that shows. Like. The driver is moving forward.,Student,22,0,,0.0,
And that looks like a good enough distance. Yeah. And you're looking at the straight thing here.,Tutor,17,1,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
Okay. So let's also explore this. Deeper. Because you've said now. From A to B. There is an increase in distance. The distance increases by 50 miles. And the time increases by one hour. And something. Is going on here with this line that you noticed earlier. It's this smooth line. So it's an easy drive. I think is the word you used. Yeah. So. What's easy about it? What's happening from A to B.,Tutor,75,4,,,1.0
It's just. It's. Like. It's just like. An equal. Okay.,Student,10,0,,0.0,
I don't know how to explain it. Okay. That's okay. I want your brain to sit with that a little bit.,Tutor,21,0,0.0,,0.0
Okay.,Student,1,0,,,
Okay. We're going to dig some more here. Where. What is going on from B to C. And again. Use these purple power words.,Tutor,24,0,,,0.0
The distance has stayed the same. But there is an increase in D. And time.,Student,15,1,,0.0,
So what's going on with the car? If the distance is staying the same.,Tutor,14,1,1.0,,0.0
But there's an increase. Maybe the car is stopped.,Student,9,0,,0.0,
Your voice is like. Maybe it's stopped. Are you convinced?,Tutor,10,0,1.0,,0.0
It's stopped. Yeah. I think it's stopped. I think it's stopped because. There's been no. Increase in the amount of distance. So it's like staying still. What is. What are they doing?,Student,32,1,,0.0,
Time.,Tutor,1,0,1.0,,0.0
I don't know.,Student,3,0,,,
"Maybe they ran out of gas. Could be. Maybe they are also like, maybe there was a car accident. Has completely stopped. Yeah. But something's gone on. That says the. Distance hasn't changed. And time has increased. So how long was the car stopped for? Half an hour. Okay.",Tutor,49,1,,,0.0
Where would you like to put point C on the map? Stay at the same. Point as B. Because the car hasn't moved. So it's still be.,Student,27,0,,0.0,
Technically at that point. Okay. So those are at the same point on the map. All right.,Tutor,17,0,1.0,,0.0
What goes on from C to D? So. The car has moved. And it's now at a hundred miles away. Okay. It is now. It has been approximately two and a half hours.,Student,33,2,,0.0,
Since. Yeah. So from a to B.,Tutor,7,0,1.0,,0.0
To B. 50 miles.,Student,4,0,,,
"All right. I want you to label that somehow. You can either do it in the text box up here, or you can label it over here on the map. We're going to keep track of that distance.",Tutor,38,1,,,0.0
From a to B. Okay. Do you want me to like.,Student,11,0,,0.0,
"Like a little mark. Mark me. Okay. So if we're going to pretend like my arrow is 50 miles from Providence. Yeah. Where. So on the map somewhere, where would that 50 miles be?",Tutor,34,0,0.0,,0.0
Where do you see that 50 miles?,Student,7,0,,,
"What do you mean? I, what do you see the 50 miles? So if we're going to pretend like my arrows, the car. Are pointing to me, right? Yeah. Tell me when to stop traveling. When you think that I've traveled a total of 50 miles. And I recognize there's no numbers on this map. This is your estimate of where you think 50 miles would be.",Tutor,67,2,1.0,,0.0
Okay. Okay. Right there.,Student,4,0,,,
"A little front, like right over here. So right where you put point B. Yeah. Okay. So the line right here. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So use your pencil tool then to label 50 miles up here somehow.",Tutor,37,1,,,0.0
Okay.,Student,1,0,,,
Yep. There you go. You got to click inside of it to start typing.,Tutor,14,0,,,0.0
Okay.,Student,1,0,,,
Okay.,Tutor,1,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
"And how far,",Tutor,3,0,,,0.0
how much distance will the car have traveled when it's traveled the whole trip? 150 miles.,Student,16,2,,0.0,
A little more than 150. Okay.,Tutor,6,0,1.0,,0.0
"So you're saying about from here to here is 50 miles. Oh,",Student,12,0,,0.0,
"Oh, wait, no, that can't be, it can't be right.",Tutor,10,0,0.0,,0.0
"Okay. Okay. So. That's like, Like it's. So. This could be split into like three sections. 50. And like, this is too little. Like this wouldn't be 50 miles. 50 miles and more. So be over like here.",Student,38,0,,0.0,
"And then it would be like over here. So. So you're saying that you want to change your mind. So you're going to click on the, the search bar or your text box. And it sounds like you want to change your mind from where you originally put BNC. Yeah. Revise your thinking.",Tutor,53,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,Student,1,0,,,
"Do we get to revise our thinking in math? Huh? Do you get to revise your thinking in math? Do you get to change your mind in math? Sometimes. Yeah, absolutely. You do. Yeah. So I'm going to click on the search bar. And I'm going to click on my rough draft thinking. And now I want to revise that and edit my work. And I want B or C to be somewhere else. So I'm going to erase the ones that I label. And you put some new dots on the map.",Tutor,93,0,,,0.0
Label what those dots are in your mind. So I'm going to label my whiteboard.,Student,15,0,,0.0,
I think I pressed something on my mouse and I accidentally exited out.,Tutor,13,0,0.0,,0.0
You just clicked off the window. I think. Cause I can still see you. You can. Okay. Good.,Student,18,0,,0.0,
Cause it had like made me exit out. Sorry about that. That's okay. Can you still see the whiteboard? Yep.,Tutor,20,0,1.0,,0.0
"I can still see you too. So we're good. So now label those dots. Okay. Yeah. Oh, that's a little bit too big. Perfect. Yeah. So that's 15. That's a hundred. And that's like one 50. So I'll delete. Oh, I know that's still a, oh my gosh. Okay. So that's a. Then this would be. And. See. And.",Student,59,1,,0.0,
"This would be D. And this would be A. So earlier you wanted this to be a, to B, because you said that this part of the map looks like this part of the graph. It's more straight. Yeah. So now. Let's explore what's going on here. This is a curvy line on the map. On the road. But it's a straight line on the graph. So what is the map keeping track of and what is the graph keeping track",Tutor,81,5,1.0,,0.0
of? The map is keeping track of the road. Maybe. Like how. Hello. And like all the turns and stuff that they have to make. And. The map is keeping track of like.,Student,33,0,,0.0,
"I'm not sure. Maybe like how much traffic. It was. Or something. Yeah. So the graph is keep, you've talked about the easy drive or an interrupted drive. So that graph is keeping track of how the car is moving somehow. Yeah. And you said C is at the same point because distance hasn't changed. So. What's the difference from B to D.",Tutor,63,3,1.0,,0.0
I'm sorry. C to D. From C to D. There is an increase in distance.,Student,15,1,,0.0,
And an increase in time. There's still that straight line from C to D. Yeah. What's that easy driver. What's that easy driver.,Tutor,23,1,1.0,,0.0
What's the difference in your mood about C to D.,Student,10,0,,0.0,
Yeah. Is the from B to C. You said the car was stopped. Yeah.,Tutor,14,0,1.0,,0.0
From C to D is the car stopped.,Student,8,0,,0.0,
"Oh, no, the car is moving. Okay.",Tutor,7,0,1.0,,0.0
How fast was the car going from B to C. The car wasn't. Going at all. Because.,Student,17,0,,0.0,
It didn't move in distance and the distance in the same. Okay. So the car. Wasn't moving at all. From C to D. The car is moving. Yeah.,Tutor,28,2,1.0,,0.0
Do you think the car is going at all. No.,Student,10,0,,0.0,
I don't think so.,Tutor,4,0,1.0,,0.0
What would we need to be able to say how fast the car is going. The amount of miles per hour.,Student,21,0,,0.0,
It's going. How fast was the car going.,Tutor,8,0,1.0,,0.0
"Per one hour. Oh, wait, no, no. What. I wouldn't give you how fast the car was going. How fast was the car going.",Student,24,0,,0.0,
I'm not sure. But something. Yeah.,Tutor,6,0,0.0,,0.0
I'm not sure. Yeah. I'm not sure. Like exactly.,Student,9,0,,0.0,
"How we would get it. How we would be able to determine how fast the car was going. Yeah. Okay. If we know. So if we say that a car is going 75 miles per hour. That means that a car has traveled 75 miles. In one hour. So the car has traveled 75 miles. In the span of one hour. Yeah. So anywhere along this graph, do we know anything about.",Tutor,72,1,0.0,,1.0
Miles and hours. Yeah. The car is traveling.,Student,8,0,,0.0,
50 miles per hour.,Tutor,4,0,1.0,,0.0
From where.,Student,2,0,,,
I don't know. How did you get 50 miles per hour? Or how did you get. Miles per hour.,Tutor,19,0,,,1.0
How did you get 50 miles per hour from a to B? Show me what you were seeing. I don't think this is from A to B because. I'm not sure. But. Probably great here.,Student,35,0,,0.0,
Goes up to 50 within an hour. Okay. So from a to B. So. The car traveled. 50 miles. In the period of. One hour. That's a weird looking five. Sorry. In the period of one hour.,Tutor,37,0,1.0,,0.0
Okay.,Student,1,0,,,
Yeah. Yeah.,Tutor,2,0,,,0.0
"Is your yeah, like a yes. I know this is 50 miles per hour. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think it's like. From a zero. And then it goes up to 50. So I'm not sure if it would be from here to here.",Student,46,0,,0.0,
Or like from here to like here.,Tutor,7,0,1.0,,0.0
"Like. Well, that's. I think this is right.",Student,8,0,,0.0,
"Yeah, this is right.",Tutor,4,0,1.0,,0.0
You're convinced now. Yeah.,Student,4,0,,,
Cause no one else would really make sense. Okay. So this line represented. Easy drive. Yeah. And this line represented.,Tutor,20,2,,,0.0
Interrupted drive.,Student,2,0,,,
"Yeah. If we know that the car is traveling 50 miles per hour. And we have this straight line here. Yeah, this shows that the car is traveling at a constant rate. Or constant speed. So from a to B, the car is traveling.",Tutor,44,1,,,0.0
"At a constant speed. Yeah. I think the straight lines. I present like 50 miles. Within the hour, because. From point C. To point D.",Student,25,1,,0.0,
That's 50 miles and that's within an hour or two. Okay.,Tutor,11,0,1.0,,0.0
And what would you label that as? Zero. Because the car hasn't moved.,Student,13,0,,0.0,
"Yeah. Yeah, we would label that as zero. Zero. Miles. Per. Hour. So from B to C, the speed. Stays the same. And then from D to E, the distance. What could you say about D to E? And now you have even more purple power words. So you have the ones that we talked about already to describe how distance is changing. You have the ones to describe how time is changing. And you have started thinking about another. Thing in this situation that we can measure. So we have.",Tutor,91,3,1.0,,0.0
And what's the unit that we use to think about speed?,Student,11,1,,0.0,
Miles per hour. Oh. Now we have speed. That is also a thing that is changing. Or staying the same.,Tutor,20,0,1.0,,0.0
So we have. From D to E. Music right here. And then from D to F. So then. That's. More than an hour. And. The distance is increasing. But it's not the full 50 miles. So. D to F. And that is within.,Student,43,1,,0.0,
"About an hour and 45 minutes. So from D to E. Yeah, explain what is happening with distance. And.",Tutor,19,1,1.0,,1.0
Using these words. Okay. With distance. That is. It's increasing. About 40 miles. And with time. There's an increase. In distance. And.,Student,22,2,,0.0,
And.,Tutor,1,0,0.0,,0.0
And. It takes. Like. Compared to the other. Like points. It takes a driver longer. To get to. E from point D. And it takes a driver a little bit longer. Did I say an hour and 45 minutes? I meant an hour and like 15. Yeah. So it takes a driver. About. 15 Minutes longer than usual.,Student,58,0,,0.0,
Okay. And earlier you described. Interrupted drive. Yeah. So. In terms of speed.,Tutor,13,0,1.0,,0.0
"What's happening from D to E with a speed. The driver's like slowing down. And then like right here, they go back. To how they were normally driving. But then they start slowing down again.",Student,35,0,,0.0,
"So it's not. 50 Miles per hour. It's not a constant speed. Or we could think about it as it's not a constant. Rate of change. Yeah. If it's a constant rate of change. Then we have this. Easy drive or the smooth line. And that means all along from C to D. Or a to B. The car is traveling at a constant speed. It's like they set cruise control. Yeah. But from D to E. It's not a constant speed. It's a constant speed. So it increases. And then it. Stays the same. And then it increases. So that means that car is stopping and going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So. Earlier. When you were talking about. Let me move these out of the way. Earlier. We talked about how we would look at the speed. And figure out how many miles. And the time of the. Situation and think about hours. And then we said we would explore a little bit about what this blue line was keeping track of. So in your own words, how would you describe.",Tutor,182,2,1.0,,0.0
What that blue line is showing or keeping track of. Yeah. The blue line kept track of like the speed.,Student,20,2,,0.0,
"The drivers going. Exactly. And the speed is this thing. That's a relationship of miles to hours. And then we said, okay, let's. Let me move this. A little bit. In this particular situation, we happen to be thinking about distance. And it's a thing that is changing. And so we could measure how it's changing. We could measure how time. In terms of hours is changing. And then what goes on in the middle of the graph. Is the number of hours. Are changing together. So no matter what type of graph you're dealing with. In school or life.
