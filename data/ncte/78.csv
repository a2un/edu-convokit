Yes.,student,1,0,,,
How would you do it?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
Just put the line.,student,4,1,,,
"If you put a line across these thirds here, you now have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?  You're right.  We can take thirds and if we cut that in half we're going to end up with 6 equal parts. So 6, you're right.  So in order to find fractional parts of not rectangles today – we've been doing a lot of rectangles, but we're going to work on groups of people, or objects, or things, so it's a little bit different, but the denominator and numerator still tells us to do the same thing, okay?  That's the other thing we're going to be doing, is reviewing what it means to have a denominator, and a numerator, and what they tell us.  I'm going to stop because I don't have all your eyes.  Student O?",teacher,135,8,,,0.0

You just put a line through—,student,6,1,,,
"Break each fourth in half?  I'm going to end up with eighths? That's correct.  Okay.  So yesterday we took some notes on fractions, right?  Tips for how to start working through fractions.  I'm actually not going to leave our notes up here.  I'm going to go ahead to the next side because I want you to be thinking.  You can look at – no, you don't have to copy anything.  No notes right now, but you can look in your notes, because what I want you to do is turn and talk with the person sitting next to you.  I want you to think about what do we know?  What is the numerator? What is the denominator?  So if we look at these three fractions up here – I'm stopping.  I'm going to stop and wait.  Okay.  Yes, I do see that there's a bug in the room, but we're going to keep focus.  Please do not distract the group.  Okay.  So there are three fractions written up here, but what I want you to be able to do – I'm going to use my pick sticks, so you want to really be able to explain it because you don’t know who I'm going to pick. Talk to your partner using these fractions about what's the numerator, what does it tell us to do, what's the denominator, what does that tell us to do, being able to explain that.  I also want you to think, what does division have to do with fractions?  Be thinking about those thoughts, okay?  So just take a minute or two to turn and talk to the person sitting next to you.  We're in the center here.  Can you guys be sure that [inaudible] is included in your conversation?  I want you to scoot over here so you're closer.  Can you please turn and talk?

Can I be on the camera?,student,6,0,,,
"No, because I don't have a permission slip for you, so you have to be this way, but you guys can now talk.  Yep.  I want you to think about what is the meaning of the numerator, what's the meaning of the denominator.  So if you look at those three fractions up there, how do you think you can explain that?  Yes, so he's not in the picture.  This area here is not in it.  Be ready to talk about these things and move forward.  Denominator is what?  Lower?  You mean the bottom half?  Okay, so denominator, if we look at those fractions up there, which – out of one fourth, which number is the denominator?  Okay.  We're talking about one fourth, so the two parts of the fraction are the numerator and the denominator.  Which of those numbers in one fourth is the denominator?  Student O, you know what?  You have to stay seated in your seat please.  If you have a problem you will move your seat.  If you're not sure, you're sitting here with two other partners who I think might be ready to talk about it, and you guys can come to a decision on what's a denominator and what does it mean.

"4 equal parts.  Okay, then what's this other number?  What's the 1?  What does the 1 tell us to do?  Student N, I haven't heard from you yet.  The 1 tells you how many to shade in.

"Okay.  Student F is starting to notice that two eighths looks like it's double of the numbers one fourth.  They are related.  Let's talk about how they're related for a second.  If we look at this – this is where we're going to need some volunteers to come help me on the SMART Board. So I need someone who can create a representation, okay, so who can actually show us the fraction on this rectangular whole, and then someone who can explain and prove whether that is correct.  We need to be able to prove why that fractional representation is correct, okay?  Student D, do you want to – actually, you know what?  Can you be the one who explains?  Because of the tape I can't have you come up to the board, but can you be the one who helps to explain? Because we can still have your voice, okay?  Can you do the explaining?  Maybe?  Okay.

I'm thinking that [inaudible].,student,4,0,,,
What do you think it is?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0

He did a good job of what?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,0.0
"Of making 4 equal groups, but the problem is he shaded in 2 of the parts.",student,16,1,,0.0,
"So the problem is, his denominator's good.  He made 4 equal parts, but his numerator is different.  He actually created two fourths, okay?  So that would make it different.  What you did before?  How would you have done one fourth?  So another way Student P could have done one fourth, do you agree she could have gotten one of these rows because there are 4 equal rows of 6, okay?  Do we have a problem, or are we fine?  Eyes are forward.  All right.  What about two eighths?  Student B, do you know how to make two eighths? Can you walk somebody through it?  I know.  I'm sorry.  We can't have you draw.  Can you explain it if somebody makes it?  Okay.  All right.  Let's see.  Who has not been up to my board yet?  Student F, do you want to try making two eighths?  Do you want to give it a try?  Okay.  Just grab the blue marker there and let's see.  Let's [inaudible]. Okay.  Two eighths.

Our numerator told us to shade in 2 of the equal parts.  That's excellent.  All right.  So now we're going to look at fractions in a slightly different way.  We're not just going to stare at a rectangle and break it in to equal parts.  We're going to think about a group of people, a group of things.  Yeah.

If I have 24 oranges, and I'm going to give one fourth of my oranges to Mr. D, because we're friends, and then I'm going to give the rest of them to Ms. A because she's another friend of mine – so I'm going to share my oranges.  I'm going to give a fourth to Mr. D, and the rest to Ms. A.  I'm going to ask you – hands down, because I'm not going to ask you to share just yet.  I want you to tell me what fraction of the oranges are going to go to Ms. A, okay?  Hold on.  I don't want any hands.  I want everyone to have think time, okay?

It's asking you to find three different things, okay?  A fraction, so what fraction Ms. A gets.  Excuse me.  But it's asking how many oranges, okay?  So this asks for a fraction, but then it asks how many oranges each of those fractions will be, okay?  I want you to solve this with a partner, okay, and you can do one of several things.  If you want to use a grid, rectangle, wrap paper, I'll give you some of these, okay?  Let me give everyone just in case you want to use it.  If you want to just use your brain, that's fine.

Talk to Student K about that.  If you know how many Mr. D is getting, we've got to prove it or think about this.

So I heard a lot of really good thinking when we were talking about this.  So who was able to use the 4 by 6 grid when they were thinking about oranges?  A couple people used the grids to help them think.  Okay.  Student F, and Student R, do you want to show us using a grid how you started to solve that problem?",teacher,119,0,,,0.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  I like that you bring your paper with you.  I hope that we're slanted and giving our attention, because I'm going to ask the audience if you agree with what they're doing. Don't use those.  Use the blue marker, and Student R, you help make sure he's doing the right thing.  Student J, Student F, you need to be facing this way so you can see. Do you need a few minutes?",teacher,73,0,,,0.0
"Ms. N, something popped out.",student,5,0,,,
"Okay.  That's because we're touching some buttons, okay?  Just don't touch anything, but use the marker.  So while Student F is working on this, why did he just create fourths? Let's follow along and see what they're working on, okay? So Student J, what did he just do?  What did Student F just do?",teacher,54,0,0.0,,1.0
He broke the 24 in to fourths.,student,7,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,0.0,,1.0
Because – wait.  He cut it in to fourths because 4 times 4 equals 24?,student,15,0,,1.0,
Now wait.  Student J said he cut it in to fourths because 4 times 4 equals – what?,teacher,18,0,1.0,,0.0
"4 times 4 equals 24. And there's 6 tiles in each square, so he shaded one for Mr. D.",student,19,1,,0.0,
"Now hold on Student J.  I'm going to ask you to repeat it.  I need you two over there to be facing forward.  Okay, we're not having a side conversation.  All right.  I want everyone to listen to what Student J just said because I think what he said was really interesting.  Student J, how did you explain that?  Now wait a second, because the people right next to you aren't focused.  If one student is speaking, the rest of us are listening.  That means your tiles aren't moving.  Go ahead, Student J.",teacher,93,0,1.0,,1.0
"Student F, he broke the 24 in to 4 squares, then he [inaudible] that 6 in to 4, so there's 6 tiles in each square, so we shaded one square for Mr. D, which he only gets 9.",student,38,3,,0.0,
He gets – you just told me there were 6 in each group.,teacher,13,0,1.0,,0.0

Three fourths.,student,2,0,,,
"Three fourths, okay?  So Student J, what you were saying, that's like how Student B explained it to me, and actually Student B, you did that without needing to use any grids or anything, did you?  How did you know how to do this without using a picture?  Student B, I know one fourth plus three fourths equals a whole, okay, so that's correct, but Student B, how did you know how many oranges would be in each group?  Sit up, Student F.",teacher,83,1,,,1.0
Because 4 times 6 is 24.,student,6,0,,,
"Because 4 times 6 is 24.  Okay.  Thank you, guys.  You can have a seat while we take a look at this.  All right.  So they made the visual that makes it clear that Mr. D has 1 of 4 equal parts, and that was 6 oranges, and Ms. A has the other 3.  When I was working with Student B, she told me that one fourth plus three fourths was going to equal four fourths, which is the same thing as one whole, right?  So she was adding fractions when she thought about it.  What about this crate right here of oranges?  What would it look like if I just wanted to show you the part that Mr. D was getting?  Student B, can you show me how many oranges Mr. D got with that picture?",teacher,137,2,1.0,,1.0

There.  Are you okay?  Let me see your hand. Let me see it.  So what you need to do is you need to go wash your hand and you can see the nurse.  Okay.  I don't know why we're getting pencils stuck in our hands.  That seems silly to me.  All right.  So Student E, what would I do to show how many oranges Mr. D got?",teacher,114,0,,,0.0

What I want you to do, I want you to work on your own on page 6 and 7, okay, and I actually photocopied it for you because I think a lot of us are missing this page.  These are actually yours that I used to make the copy.  Thank you.  Okay, so 6 and 7 have more problems about different groups of objects.  You've got marbles, toy cars, and different collections, okay?  So everyone's getting this page in case you don't have it. Student R, we don’t want to be singing.  It's distracting for the group.

I need tiles.,student,3,0,,,
"Or your grid.  Okay, you're going to use division?  Okay.  So you created your own grid right there.  That looks really great.  So you've created a 4 by 6.  What made you create a 4 by 6, Student B?",teacher,39,1,,,1.0

His sister is going to get two eighths, and we wonder, how many marbles is that?  In this case our whole [inaudible].

"Should I do a grid, like a—",student,7,0,,,

We can make groups of 3?  Is that what you said?,teacher,11,0,1.0,,1.0

So if you're working with 24 marbles, right, you're making groups of 8.  I agree with you that if you break 24 in to 8 equal groups, there's going to be 3 in each, right?  So let's just think about those 8 groups that you made, right? Here's my 8 groups, and you said that there's going to be 3 in each.  So we have our representation here, right?

You know how to use the denominator, break it in to equal groups, then you might want to be making a representation to think about those groups so you can visualize it and think about how many of those groups you're talking about, okay?  I want you to try that when you look at 2.  This is not right, but now we have this visual to help us remember what's correct, okay? This was right.  You figured out how many marbles would be in each of your 8 groups.  That was good, but now we just need to think about what does 2 of those groups mean, our numerator, right?

This one is talking about toy cars.  So we're thinking about a different fraction.  You're going to want to use your representation, but now when you think of 24, we're talking about toy cars.  I want you to try and work on this too, on your own.  Okay, now how many are going to be in each of the equal parts that you created? 24 was your whole, and you made 4 equal parts.  Okay.  Can I have your attention back up here?  Okay.  I saw a lot of good discussion happening in some of our groups as I walked around.  People were helping each other to use visuals.  I saw a lot of grids.  I saw some people drawing actual pictures, and I saw some people just thinking through the math by using division, okay?  When we pick up tomorrow, we're going to talk about that third problem that some of you may have gotten to.  It was a crate of fruit, and there were different amounts, three different types of fruit in this one crate.  We had different fractions to represent. We're going to pick up with that tomorrow, okay?  But what we need to do before we get ready for lunch, I have a real quick reflection that  I want to work on because I need to take this with me to see – if you work on this on your own, I want something to take home to see what you're thinking about fractions, okay?  It's going to be really short.  I can't hear you sweetheart.  I'll answer you when I come back there, okay?  Can I have you guys before I give you this reflection – I'm going to wait because I need your attention.  I'm just waiting.  Excuse me.  Okay.  What we worked on today, I want it in your blue folder because when we come back on Monday, we're going to go over it, okay, just the third question.  If you didn't finish it, that's okay, but I want you to tuck it in your blue folder, then clear your desk.  All you need is a pencil to take a look at this, okay?  If you're not at your own desk, I'm sorry. If you're in a different seat, just put your things to the side, okay?  Oh, excellent.  Yes.  Good work, Student F. That looks really good.  We're going to use it tomorrow, what you saved in your blue folder.  Save that with the sheets so we have proof.  Quickly clear your desk.  Student D, Student H, Student J, you can stay where you are. Student O, are you touching that?",teacher,477,6,,,0.0

"Have a seat please.  We need to stay seated.  This is not a time to walk around.  Can you clear your desk so I can give you a reflection, please?  Just move it to the side. Student B, it goes in your blue math folder.  I need you to be seated in three, two, one.  Student S, and Student B, are we ready?",teacher,63,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"All right.  There are just two questions on here, pretty straightforward.  It's what we've been working on, okay? Talking about eighths and fourths.  I ask you to explain your thinking, so you need to use words and say, ""I know this because.""  I want you to tell me how you know this. If you have questions when you get this, I can walk around and help you to understand what it's asking you to do, but you do have to write words to explain how you know what fractions on your reflection.  You're welcome, Student E. As soon as you get it, put your name on it and start. Excuse me.  The conversation ends now.  You're working on this independently.  I didn't say that you did.  I'm asking you to start your math reflection.  Name on top.  Student C, you need to do this too.",teacher,145,1,,,0.0

"Well this is 4th grade, a little harder than 3rd grade.  We have homework everyday.  Thank you.  Student O, I'm going to take your tiles now please.  Thank you.  Put your name on the reflection and start right away.  Please start.  You know, I'm going to start moving people down, because when we take a reflection, that's an independent, quiet time, and if you're talking, I'm going to assume you're just getting your answer from a neighbor.  You're smart enough to show this on your own.  If you're writing your answer, you need to explain why and show how, because it says, ""Explain why using pictures and words.""",teacher,108,0,,,0.0
"Ms. N, this makes no sense.  It says, ""Why not?""",student,10,0,,0.0,
"It asks you to explain your thinking.  It says, ""I know this because.""  How do you know it?  Okay.  Same thing.  Explain your thinking.  So how do you know that that is or is not? This is where the words come in.  I want to see that you're able to explain what you think.  You can make some pictures on that grid to show me as well what you're thinking.  You need to [inaudible]?  Okay.",teacher,75,0,1.0,,0.0

"Did you say yes or no?  This is a shaded area.  I want you to write yes or no, then explain what you think, okay, and tell me why.  Okay.  Is that area one eighth?  I want you to think about whether or not that's one eighth.  You might want to draw on it and figure out if that's actually an eighth.  Student H, you answered the first question, but then it says, ""Explain your thinking.""  So how do you know? You can say, ""I know this because.""  Explain all of them. I don't want you to say, ""Because I made one eighth out of it.""  I want you to actually look at this drawing.  How do you know in this particular drawing that it will be an eighth?  Then whatever you've drawn there, explain in your words, okay?  Now, but that's different.  This piece isn't fitting in to any of the other ones that you made.",teacher,157,2,,,1.0
It fits in to that one too.,student,7,0,,,
"Okay, so it's the same size as that?  Why don't you make your drawing so that it works with that piece?  I think you can do that.  Yes sweetheart?  Okay, so that's our grid.  This is our – nah-uh.  This is independent.  I need to see what you know on your own.  Are you finished?",teacher,55,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  I'll be right back.  This is our 4 by 6 grid that we've been working with.  So it's asking you is the shaded area one eighth?  Explain your thinking using the rectangle. You need to figure out is that one eighth.  You were our eighth making expert today, so does that look like an eighth?  Okay.  Let's think about it, all right, and if it's not, you want to explain what fraction it is.  That is not an eighth.",teacher,80,3,,,0.0
Do I have to write?,student,5,0,,,

"Write what you just said out loud, write that down.  What I did is I broke in half, then I created fourths, then – okay. So what do you think it is?  How many equal parts did you just get?",teacher,40,0,1.0,,0.0
"I just made – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 – 7.  This doesn't count because it's shaded in already.",student,21,0,,0.0,
"But we have equal parts.  The shaded in part is part of a whole.  The denominator tells us how many equal parts. That's still part of the shape.  That's just shaded in. That's the fraction shaded in, but we think it's still one of the parts in this whole, so we still count it.  Take out your independent book while you're waiting.  One minute, okay?  I'm just going to let people finish up.  Do you have your book?  You can read at your desk while you're waiting. Thank you.  You all done, Student B?  I didn't see you answer this one.  It says, ""Explain your thinking.""  I don't see any words on the page.  Thank you, Student R. Student I, I can see your illustration, but try to use words to explain what you thought, okay?
