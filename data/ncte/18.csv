"Okay.  All right.  All right.  Today we’re gonna continue with making our boxes.  But we’re gonna do something a little bit different today.  Today, the packaging factory doesn’t want all the same size packages.  And, remember that each of our cubes was a package?  And the things we made were the box. Now, we’re gonna have some different size packages in our boxes today.  So, we’re gonna have a package that looks like this.  Like this.  Like this.  A nice long one.  And then a real big package and one that looks like this. So, what we’re gonna begin to do this morning is I’m going to give you the worksheet and I’m going to have you make a box. Everybody is making the same box today and it’s already framed for you.  All right?  So, you’re gonna make this box and you have the extensions to put on the box. So, everybody’s gonna make a box.  When I give you the sheet I’m gonna ask you to tell me what size box you think this is going to be.  Okay?  So, could you pass them out?  I can’t have Student D pass them out because he is not part of the [Inaudible]. Okay, Student J.  I’m sorry, Student J, what did you say?",teacher,214,1,,,0.0
