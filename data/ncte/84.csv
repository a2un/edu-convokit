Shoes.,student,1,0,,,
"You’re talking about shoes.  So we looked at a line graph being something that we want to look at, something over a period of time.  Did anyone have a graph idea that used a period of time?

"So how long it takes to travel somewhere.  So we could each look at travelling.  Or, we could talk about how long it takes us to get to school.  We could use information about how long it takes people to get to school.  So that’s what we’re going to do with our graph is at the top we’re going to give it a title.  At the top of your page you’re going to put down – our title is, “How Long It Takes To Get To School.” That’s going to be our title.  So our title is – so you have, “How Long It Takes To Get To School.” So we have our title on our board, so everyone’s writing that down on top of there.  If you don’t have your book, just get out a piece of paper. So at the top you have, “How Long It Takes To Get To School”.  So the data this graph will be showing is how long it takes people to get to school.  So we write our title nice and neat, nice and neat.  And then on number one we write down, “How Long It Takes To Get To School,” on number one. Next we want to look at putting information in our graph.  What is going to go on our vertical?

We want something different to show how long it takes to get to school.  So someone said bike.  So Student Z, we’re going to use ways.  We’re going to do how people get to school, and then that would let us know how long it takes people to get there.  So we have bike, walk.  Start writing that down.

"So one of the things we have that’s very important is when we have a graph, we need to understand what the graph is asking us.  It’s not asking you how much money has, it’s telling you what the value of the car was.  From there we can then start to generate some ideas.  Let’s turn to the next page, they want you to come up with another question. I want you now at your table with your group to come up with two more questions in relationship to the bar graph.  Now that we know it’s not about how much money, it’s the value of the car.  What are two more questions you can ask using the bar graph, using that information, and then come up with the answer.  So go ahead.  Actually what I want you to do is just give the question.  I’m going to have somebody else at another table answer your question.  So together come up with two more questions for B and C.  Don’t answer it. We’ll pass it on to someone else. Start working with your group.  You all need to work together to work and find answers for B and C.  You can leave that over here.  One of you should have the page open to page 79 so that you can look at the graph, no books needed right now, we’re right here.  We’re on page 79.  Turn to page 79 and come up with two answers for B and C.  Just the questions. You don’t have to give the answers, just the questions. What was the value.  The value.  The value of the car.  Your labels are -- you’re dealing with the value of the car and you’re dealing with years.  So your question should word very similar.  You’re doing a question for B and for C.  Talk about what could be a question.  You can now turn to page 80 so you can write your question.  Student C has got a good question.

Remember we were talking about how much is the car, what is the value.  How… You’re kind of giving me an answer here. What’s the value? We know it went down every year because each year the price changed, the value.  So instead of giving an answer you could say, how much did the car change in value over each year?

This again is information that has to do with favorite sports, a group of students.  So we have a table.  Next we’re going to look at the graph that we learned.  We have a line graph.  Let’s take a look at the line graph.  And the big idea is graphs and tables are visual tools for showing and analyzing data.

Student book?,student,2,0,,,
"Student book.  This is your student book.  Hardback book. Student book.  I’m making it very easy clear of what book I’m talking about.  In your hardback student book you have pages, so we’re going to put Math Student Book, pages 154 to 158, do even problems.  And on Wednesday you’ll have your Chapter 4 test.  So this is you getting yourselves studying for your Chapter 4 test.  So let’s review what pages.  So you have number 2, which is answering a vocabulary word.  Number 4 you have a bar graph.  4 has 4 a, b, c, d, e and f, those all need to be answered.  Then turning to the next page on page 156 you aren’t going to do page 156, that’s an odd problem. You’re going to then do page 157, which is you have a graph and you’re going to answer a, b, and c.  Then we have page 158.  That is a problem 7.  You will not do that problem this evening.  So it’s not that much.  I won’t be doing this all the time, but I want the papers neat.  Let’s label it.  You’re going to put your name and date.  You’re going to put “Chapter Review Test,” that goes at the top of your page.  “Chapter Review Test”.  So you have your name, date, the title of your paper.  Chapter – it’s right there in your book – Review – you don’t have to put test.  Chapter Review, name, date, and then put your math away and get your social studies out.  You have your homework, feet down Student A, and put your homework in your homework folder with your homework sheet.  Chapter Review.  If you don’t have a homework folder you need to ask for one at home. Put that on your homework sheet.  Paper needs to be turned neatly.  You need to have a folder for your homework sheet and your homework.  Student C?",teacher,322,3,,,0.0
