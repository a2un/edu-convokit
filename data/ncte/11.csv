[Inaudible].  It would be [25].,student,5,0,,,
No.  You could change it to 25.  Right.  Now maybe there was a mistake when they wrote this problem.  I didn't write the problem.  Okay.  But the suggestion would be to change the number 27 to 25.  Now I didn't change it on purpose when I started because I wanted you to figure it out.  And good. Now if you change it to 25 would be what?  How many students?,teacher,70,0,1.0,,0.0

Two-fifths of 35.  Yeah.  You got to find out what's two-fifths of 25?  Okay.  Did you do it?,teacher,18,0,,,1.0
"Yes, we did.",student,3,0,,,
Okay.  Did you – are you doing that?  Are you working together?,teacher,12,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
I want to know how you're doing that last question.  Okay.  Let me see.  Correct.  Yes then how did you find out?,teacher,22,0,,,1.0
Because you said the one of the number would be the two and five.  So I thought –,student,18,0,,1.0,
Can you write the equation there?  Write the equation there.,teacher,10,2,0.0,,0.0
So you said –,student,4,0,,,
To question A.  What's the equation?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
You said three –,student,4,0,,,
Three what?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Three –,student,2,0,,,
"Three-fifths, right?",teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Three-fifths.  Yeah.  Three-fifths.,student,3,0,,,
"Is that plus, right?",teacher,4,0,,,0.0
"Yeah, plus.",student,2,0,,,
Plus what?  Are you gonna what?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Equals the –,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
"Five-fifths, right?",student,2,0,,,
Okay.  Now what's the answer here?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Two.,student,1,0,,,
Two?,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
Two-fifths.,student,1,0,,,
"Yes, two-fifths.  Then what fraction of the students in the course are in fifth grade?",teacher,15,1,,,0.0
Two-fifths.,student,1,0,,,
"Two-fifths.  Good.  And that's the answer, right?",teacher,7,0,,,0.0
Two-fifths.,student,1,0,,,
Then move to once you're done with that move to question B. Then you got to write – okay just circle it or write it. Write the see.,teacher,28,1,,,0.0
Can I explain?,student,3,0,,,
Yes.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
We took two-fifths of 35 and then we did 35 times two equals 70.  79 divided by 5 equals 14.,student,20,1,,0.0,
How do you – where do you come up with two-fifths?,teacher,11,0,1.0,,1.0
"Because we found out that there are two-fifths of the students in fifth grade in chorus so then we did – we put two- fifths.  The first two-fifths is the students in fifth grade.  And then we put three-fifths of the total, which is 35.  And then we got 14 because we did 35 times two equals 70.  And 70 divided by five equals 14.",student,65,2,,1.0,
14.  Yep.  Yep.,teacher,3,0,1.0,,0.0
14 of the students – 14 of the students aren't in –,student,12,0,,0.0,
Did you the same?  Did you do the same?,teacher,9,0,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Now, that's good.  I like that.  Okay.  Do you agree also with them?  Let me see.  Okay.  One at a time.  Excuse me. Excuse me.  One at a time.  She's talking now.",teacher,32,0,,,0.0
The answer and the answer is 14 but he doesn't agree with us.,student,13,0,,0.0,
That's fine.  That's fine.,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
He thinks that – Did you ask him?,student,8,0,,0.0,
Okay.  Hold on.,teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
He thinks two has a remainder but it doesn't.,student,9,1,,0.0,
Now let me hear your point.,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
I think the answer's not 14 because –,student,8,0,,0.0,
And why?,teacher,2,0,0.0,,1.0
Just [we put shoulders on the bird].  So on part A it says 100 minus 60 equals 40 so I drew – if you put four it's gonna give you the the 40 but I took it out.,student,38,0,,0.0,
Four is from the forty?  Did you say four from the forty?  Did you get four from the forty?  Is that what you got?,teacher,24,0,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Now, they didn't – they said they didn't.  Now how did you solve it?  How you solve it and came up with – ? What's the answer?  The answer that you got.",teacher,33,0,,,1.0
The answer is [some] 35 times 4 equals –,student,9,0,,0.0,
Where do you come up with four?  Excuse me.  Let him finish. Go ahead.,teacher,14,0,1.0,,0.0
Four is from the forty.,student,5,0,,,
How so?  Excuse me.  Let him finish.  Let him think.  Let him say.  Okay.  How so?,teacher,16,0,0.0,,1.0
"Because I know that 100 minus 60 it gives you 40, so you take out",student,15,0,,1.0,
"But now that's – is that the way that you solve the problem?  I don't think that is a good way to solve this problem.  Now, because 40 over here.  Listen.  Let me say this.  40 doesn't have anything to do with this problem.  It does in a certain way because two-fifths is the same as 40 percent. But once you're solving this problem over here, you're not gonna take four from this number 40, all right, to solve it. Now there's a way to do it.  Now you have 35 students, right?  Thirty-five students the whole number, right?",teacher,99,2,1.0,,0.0
Mm-hmm. find out the number of students in the course who are in the fifth grade.  Now you know the fraction of the fifth grade students in the course.  Do you know that?  What's the fraction?  You found it out somewhere else here. The fraction's two-fifth.,student,46,3,,0.0,
Two-fifth.  Right.  And then it's two-fifths of how many students?,teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0
Thirty-five.,student,1,0,,,
Thirty-five students.  Now what you're gonna do is to find what? To find out two-fifths of 35.  Now remember how to find a fraction of a whole number?  Do you remember that? How you find the fraction of a whole number.  And the fraction's two-fifths of 35.  Or it should be 35 over here not 25.  Now what to do to find out.  What do you want to do to find out that two-fifths of 35?  I want him to think and tell me.,teacher,84,5,,,1.0
Are we going to do 35 minus four?,student,8,0,,0.0,
Minus four again?,teacher,3,0,1.0,,0.0
No.  Thirty-five minus forty.,student,4,0,,,
Why are you bringing 40 to this – excuse me.  Okay.  Why are you bringing forty to this equation right here?,teacher,21,1,,,1.0
Because two-fifths equals forty.,student,4,0,,,
Yeah.  I understand that.  Two-fifths equals forty.,teacher,7,0,,,0.0
You do 40 minus 35.  It gives you five.,student,9,0,,0.0,
"No, it's not gonna work like that.  Forty is percent.  Then if you're gonna mix percent with a whole number – with a whole number and a fraction -- a fraction number, you're gonna create a problem.  Now this is what you're going to do. I'm trying to understand your idea.  I know why you're thinking like that maybe because two-fifths is 40 percent. Right?",teacher,65,7,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"And this case it would be 40 percent plus what gives you 100 percent then see the difference between the two in percent, which would be 60 percent then convert the 60 percent into a fraction.  And find out how – what number of students the fraction represents.  That would be complicated.  Now let's – there is an which I can see to be an effective one to solve this problem, which is to find two-fifths of 35.  What do you do?  What'd you do?  Can you tell him what you did?",teacher,92,8,,,1.0
Yeah.  We did two times 35 equals 70.,student,8,0,,0.0,
Okay.  Two times 35.,teacher,4,0,1.0,,0.0
So 70 divided by five equals 14.  So 14 of the – there are 14 –,student,16,1,,0.0,
"Do you see what she did?  She multiplied or they multiplied two times 35, right, which is 70.  70 divided by five is 14. Or she could do this.  Thirty-five divided by five, which is seven.  Then seven times two could be 14.  That's the answer to the question.  The answer is there are how many students?",teacher,57,4,1.0,,0.0
14.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"14.  Fourteen students.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Boys and girls, you did a great job working on these problems.  Actually this problem with one, two, three parts.  Three questions. Now this is – this is great.  You did great.  Excellent. You could come and share but we're already out of time. That's why we got to stop it here and you guys did great. You did great.  Excellent job.  Excellent job.  And you demonstrated that you know your fractions and your percents and hopefully that you'll continue to do to your best in order to learn more.  All right?
