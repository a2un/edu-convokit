Student C.  She said why do we have to do this?  What’s the point?  We talked about it a little bit.  But now that you’ve played and built some boxes – why would people have to know how to find volume?  Why do we create a formula for this?,teacher,49,1,,,1.0

"Like, say you’re building a house and, like, if you could find the surface area, but not just because it’s a big surface area, it doesn’t mean it has a big volume.  So, maybe, you could have like a small surface area, but a big volume.",student,46,8,,1.0,
"Okay.  That’s a different idea.  She’s taking it – comparing it to surface area.  We talked about surface areas when we measure the whole outside, not the inside.",teacher,28,6,1.0,,0.0
"Like, you could have a bigger surface area because the volume –but the same volume.  I’m not really sure if that’s true, but –",student,24,4,,1.0,
"Okay.  So, maybe, that’s something we can work on and figure out.  What do you think, Student J?",teacher,18,0,0.0,,1.0

So, you shouldn’t have to sit here – I know some of us we’re having a ball filling it with cubes, but you shouldn’t have to do that all the time. What we’re gonna talk about today is what happens if the situation changes?  For example, you have your hands up, but you don’t know what I mean.  What would happen – I’m packing my boxes for my shipping company, Student J.  And all of a sudden, you know how if you order something, orders can change, right?  What happens if my order changes?

"You’re gonna be building again.  So, look at the new page you put in.  And you see how it says, “Doubling the number of cubes”? Our shipping company is gonna work with a box and they’re gonna just give us the dimensions right now, okay?  You see this?  This is what they’re giving us.  So, if you look at Page 11, it says, “Doubling the number of cubes.”  And it tells you at the top, “Answer the question.  Use grid paper, cubes and anything that helps you solve this problem.”  Okay? So, you can use the cubes.  We have tons of the paper.  We have the scissors.  We have the tape if you want to build. But it says, “You have a box that is 2 by 3 by 5.  How many cubes does it hold?  How do you know?” Now, do you have to build that box to find the volume now?",teacher,153,7,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  We have a formula and we can figure it out and that’s great.  But what I really want you guys to focus on is I understand you’re gonna find the volume for that box and I know you’re gonna do it easily. But look at Number 2, “The factory wants you to build a box that’ll hold twice as many cubes.” So, you need to find the volume for the first one and get that answer correct, right?  Multi-step.  Then, you have to double that volume.  And after you double that volume, you have to figure out how can you create a box – what are the dimensions gonna be for your new box that you create for the factory?  Okay? So, what I want you to do is really pay attention to this right here, the dimensions.  Okay? ’Cause then underneath it, it asks you, “Write the dimensions and explain how you found the answer.  Draw the design for the new box.” And then, the challenge is gonna be, if you work for this company, can you go above and beyond and build them a lot of boxes that’ll hold double the number of cubes?

"– that holds 24 stacked up.  I could have one that holds 2 columns with 12 in each and the box would be tall and skinny.  So, boxes can be different sizes, right?  Your job after you double the volume for Number 2 and you create a box is to then try to come up with as many dimensions as you possibly can for that box. And you can build them if you want with paper.  You can build them if you want just with cubes.  You’re just gonna build today, okay?  You’re kind of being math scientists right now.  Got it?

And then, for Number 3, you can – kind of like we talked about before, conjectures are kind of like guesses in math, right?  You can come up with conjectures and say, oh, well, I think 10 times 1 times 3 is gonna work or something like that. But how do you know?  You have to find some way to figure out if that’s gonna work.  You have to build it or draw it or be able to explain it to us.  ’Cause what we’re gonna do is I have a chart that we’re gonna put up at the end and we’re gonna come up with all different ways that we can build that new box.

"Oh, okay.",student,2,0,,,
"And that’s kind of like what we said here, we can double this, keep this, but then we got to cut this in half.  So, we kind of have to play with two numbers here.  So, who can – come on, hands up.  I want more people sharing dimensions now that we’ve come up with this idea. We shouldn’t have to sit and build and cut and tape anymore.
