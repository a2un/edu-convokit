"Okay, can I have everyone’s eyes right up here, please?  We’re gonna get started in math today after two snow days, Student C.  It’s been kind of fun.  Before we—before the two snow days we were working on the subtraction—finding the difference between any three digit and 1,000.  I'm gonna do a— I'm gonna do a quiz dome check right after lunch that is— I'm gonna do a quiz dome chick that I put two questions on at the end—right after we get back from lunch so that I can just check in to make sure that that is still going okay with you because today we’re switching gears.  So turn your eyes to the whiteboard.  So Student C, we’re going to be focusing on combining three digit problems.  And as far as language goes, I'm going to be listening to how you describe the addition strategy that you use.  So there’s a word up here I want to know if you know, and it’s this word.",teacher,167,4,,,0.0

Put them together.,student,3,0,,,
"Put them together.  Who agrees?  Good.  All right, so when we’re thinking math wise and we’re thinking numbers, if I want to combine three and eight, what am I gonna get for an answer?  What’s my sum?  Student A?",teacher,39,1,,,0.0
Eleven.,student,1,0,,,
"Eleven.  Okay, so, Student A, that’s the goal of us today. It’s addition is what we’re doing.  We’re combining numbers.  We do—we all have different ways of combining numbers.  So today you're gonna feel good at the end of math about one specific strategy that you want to use as your way to add numbers.  So we’re gonna be starting on page 16 and 17.  So I do want us to look at 16.  I have tried to draw a map of what 16 is.  So look at page 16. Now you're gonna want to turn your book horizontally because you want to look at this map—the ____ one. Remember earlier in this unit I said Teacher L went on a trip.  She drove—page 16—she drove 632 miles—yep, unit 5, thank you, Student K, for helping him.  Earlier in this unit I said Teacher L took a trip.  She drove 632 miles and she wanted to go 1,000 miles.  Do you remember this conversation?",teacher,164,6,,,0.0

The state.,student,2,0,,,
"The states.  So I put our class map up here so you recognize what it is.  It’s not fully the northeast region because it has some of the southeast—so Student J—but that’s what you're looking at, okay?  So the Jones family is part of in the northeast, but there’s a couple on there that are the southeast.  So what I tried to do—look over here—not perfect by any means, Student J.  I tried to as best I could incorporate the northeast region of our country and the top part, the northern part, of the southwest.  Okay? So the Jones family is going to be taking a trip and this map—whenever you take  trip, you—people tend to have an atlas out.  It’s a book of maps.  And they tend to chart where they're going, right?  So the Jones family does that. And I gave you each a crayon so that you could just trace their dotted lines.  So can everyone just darken their dotted lines?  Can you start though—here’s their home in Akron, Ohio.  So start there.  This is where their—just trace those dotted lines.  That way you can clearly see the route that they took.",teacher,195,3,,,0.0

"We’ll talk about that in one sec.  I just wanted to make sure that you understood what that map was showing, okay?  Now the next thing that these people are showing on their map, Student J, is they put dark bulleted circles—dark circles—at their stops.  So Teacher L when she goes places, she’ll stop like to go to the bathroom or to go sightseeing or to get some food.  Each of the Jones’ family stops, they put a dark circle at the stop.  So what I’d like you to do is darken their stops with your crayon.  So they started at Akron, and then I see a Niagara Falls there’s a dot.  I see Auburn, New York is a dot.  I see New York City.  And I'm reading these words just in case the towns are not familiar.  I see a dot at Virginia Beach.  I see dot at a Mammoth Cave.  So— What I’d like you to do is just use your finger for a minute, Student C, and start at Akron and just trace.  Student S, just trace the route that they took.",teacher,185,3,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Just so you realize this is them in their car driving.  So Student S, just trace that route just so you have a sense. So they start here, and then where did they go?  Okay.  So if you're tracing around then you see that that’s—you're pretending that that’s their car traveling.  All right, so now we’re ready to think about the comment—the combining of numbers.  So Student A, I don’t want you coloring in that, okay?  I just wanted you to trace the route that they took. The question on page 17 says what at the top?  Nice loud voices.

No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  Not many more, right, Student A, than three miles.  We could travel three miles from here to South Bay Plaza maybe.  It might be more or less just by a little, but it’s about three.  So three miles one day and five miles the next day, would be a total of what?",teacher,53,1,,,0.0

It’s gonna step-by-step me and tell you where they go from Akron to this maybe.  It’s gonna break down for you in these three problems.  Read closely.  Make sense of that problem.  Use this map, Student T, to help you. As you're picturing and visualizing, Student C, you can feel free to write on that map how many miles go from the distance between one place to another before you start adding that. I do want you working in a partner or a small group right near you.  Don’t move seats because of the camera, but I do want you listening to your conversations.  Some of you have some really good ideas probably about how to go about combining these numbers.  Some of you might be stuck.  All right?  So go ahead and start your work.

How did you two figure out Student B and I were listening to your conversation?  [Inaudible]. Yeah, I think Teacher L is.  I think.  So you're using the algorithm and what are you using?  And then what?  So you're adding 700?  So one of those circles was—what place was it?  What is the 700 and the 400?  What places is it? [Inaudible]. [Inaudible].  You have to solve each of these.  Combining numbers to get the same answer.  I'm going to ask all three of you to—or maybe you're bringing out successful adding of these numbers using traditional algorithms.  That’s okay if that’s how you did it—where you line up the numbers.  So what I want you to think of—this is what I want you to think about when you finish that sheet, if you still have anything that’s—to think about when adding all these numbers.

So in the third week, the Jones family went to four places in New York State.  They drove 259 miles from ______ to Auburn, New York.  So where did they just leave from?  New York City?  So they drove 259 miles.  And then they drove 128 more miles.  [Inaudible].  So using this map, you would read that there’s three stops there.  So are there three numbers here?  So do you think you agree now that you have been reading?  Up here you added two numbers, up here you added two numbers.  You need paper?

How do you get 360?  [Inaudible]. I think it’s fine that—you are correct.  It is 70 plus 90 is 160.  How did you know then that the answer would not be 160 but 360?,teacher,34,0,,,1.0

You're gonna have to help her find the numbers in the problem.  So you have a strategy for adding 27 and 33?  Can you solve that using that strategy?  Got ahead and ad 27 plus 33.

The work you did in first grade where you had to add, Student E, your basic facts—when Teacher B said 4 plus 7 is eleven and you had to learn that, that has not changed.  Okay?  It’s still here. Four and seven are always going to be eleven.  We’re just dealing with the hundreds now.  So what is 20 and 30? Everybody.",teacher,69,2,1.0,,0.0

But for those of you that were, like, a little unsure of your place—which was the tens, which was the one, which was the hundreds—his strategy is a really good one because he just draws this line down.  All right? And he did the same thing up here.  And the rest is the same.  Thank you, Student S.  Now, Student T, you did something very interesting.  I really liked it.

The people who just did the algorithm—Student J, you're not one of them but there’s a bunch of you in here.
