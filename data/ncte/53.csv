Over here?,student,2,0,,,
"Yes.  Now even if you’ve done this before, there’s still some steps that people are forgetting, so we’re gonna go back over and review to make sure we understand exactly the step- by-step process.  You know the first thing you have to do is draw your box correctly. So, after you draw your box, the number that you are going to multiplying, which is 346 times 23, you are gonna place correctly on your box.  First number, 346, goes at the top just like this.  Second number, 23, goes vertical, down the side, right hand side of your box. Then, to draw the miniature boxes inside of your lines, you look at the number and draw a line right in between 3 and 4 and you draw a line right in between 4 and 6.  You look horizontal and your numbers on the right hand side of 23, you draw a line in between 2 and 3.  That’s how you know how to draw your boxes and how many you need in each column and each row. Now you have to draw diagonals, corner to corner; you’re gonna draw a diagonal in each box, each of your small boxes.",teacher,199,9,,,0.0
