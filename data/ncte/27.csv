Student C said that she noticed from 0 to one-half was 4 inches.  What else?  Yes?,teacher,16,0,,,1.0
10 centimeters long.,student,3,1,,,
"Or 10 centimeters from 0 to the half.  So I’m going to put my ruler [inaudible] half is 10 centimeters.  You can’t really see that well with mine, but you have your own in front of you.  Then what about one-half to 1?",teacher,43,3,,,0.0
Same thing [inaudible]. [Inaudible.],student,4,0,,,
"Okay.  Student G chose to use the inch side, and she says from 0 to one-half is 4 inches, and from one-half to 4 is also 4 inches.  So, does that prove that the one-half is exactly in the middle?",teacher,40,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  What you’re going to do today is you’re going to fill in the rest of it.  Watch me.  I’m going to show you something that’s going to be a tool that you could use to fill in the rest of it.  I want you to take your ruler and I want you to put in, vertically from the one-half all the way down so that it looks like this, and actually connecting on a dot that’s at the bottom of the fraction track.  Look at what I did.  No.  See, the edge of the ruler.  Edge of the ruler. Not the line in the middle of the ruler.  The edge of the ruler.",teacher,114,8,,,0.0

What’s a half?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,

At 0.,student,2,0,,,
"0 what?  Zero tenths.  So, can somebody tell me what we’re going to label this dot right here?",teacher,18,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"Do you see what I did here, Student M?  So this dot at the bottom here – see where I’m pointing?  What are we going to label that?  You were saying a half, but we’re dealing with zero tenths at the beginning.  So can you think of how many tenths is going to be equal to that?",teacher,57,2,,,0.0
Five.,student,1,0,,,
Five-tenths.  So now label yours five-tenths.,teacher,6,2,,,0.0

The eighths.,student,2,0,,,
"On the eighths – he’s saying that he knows four-eighths is also equal to a half.  So we’re going to put a dot right in line there, on the eighths track, right here, and Student A wants to label it four-eighths.  Does everybody agree?",teacher,44,1,,,0.0

Student D, can you give me another fraction that would be equivalent to one- half that we could put on our track?  So Student D wants to go again to the fourths.  So if I am the fourths track, put a dot halfway, and we’re going to label it what?",teacher,70,2,0.0,,0.0
Two-fourths.,student,1,0,,,
Two-fourths.  Good job.  So these are all lined up.  Okay. Student G says that three-sixths is also equivalent to what?,teacher,20,2,,,0.0

Three.,student,1,0,,,
"Three-sixths.  Great job.  Okay.  Now, you can also take your ruler – like you did with the halves – and you could measure halfway.  So if I measure halfway from zero-fourths to two-fourths, what should I have?  How many inches?  How many inches?",teacher,43,3,,,0.0

Four inches.,student,2,0,,,
"Four inches.  So it’s safe to say that when we did this, all of our tracks are halfway.  All right.  What you’re going to do – I’m going to let you go off and I’m going to let you label the rest of the tracks yourself.  If you are having difficulty, these are the tracks that you need to have.  So we just completed the halves, are done.  So the thirds. Find the thirds track.  You have labeled one-thirds done for you.  One-third, two-thirds, and three-thirds are done for you.  The fourths, the fifths, sixths, eighths, and tens.  These are the tracks that you are labeling on your tracks.  Some of them are done for you.  Okay.

Equivalent fractions.,student,2,1,,,
"Equivalent fractions. That’s what we’re really looking for. Use the equivalent fractions to help you.
