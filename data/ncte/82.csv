"Boys, I need you to put that away, please.   These lights didn’t come on and these went on so I put these on and then I waited a little bit and I hit that. And then they all lit up, so we’re recording right?  We’re on? Okay.  I wanted to double check. Thanks.  All right, Student D, away with that please.  It’s on. Okay, guys.  Take a look at the back of the room, the math objectives today.  Students determine the number of cubic centimeters that fill an unmarked box.  An unmarked box. Up until now we’ve been putting together boxes and packing them with packages, cubes that made up packages to see how many of those packages would fit.  These boxes were marked.  Today is gonna be a little different.  Today you’re gonna work in groups of two.  This is a group, this is a group, you two boys in the back are a group, you two are a group and you two will be a group.  Okay?",teacher,169,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Today’s a little different.  Today they’re not telling you, they’re not putting marks on the box.  It’s unmarked. You’re gonna construct one box and unlike the other boxes, this box is gonna have a top.  And what we’re gonna do is we’re gonna find out how many of these cubic centimeters can fit inside the unmarked box. See, the problem is, though, I don’t have enough cubic centimeters for everybody to just pack these in and line up the whole bottom and find out how many levels high it is.  Okay? We’re gonna have to figure out another bit.  I’m not gonna give you any help on this.  I need you guys to figure it out.  We have supplies over there and I’ll have you guys go and get them. But first I want to show you guys how to make the box, okay?  So, over there you’re gonna find this sheet.  You need one per group.  Okay?  And you’ll work with your partner figuring this out.  So, you’ll take that sheet and you’re gonna cut out the pattern.  Okay?  And when you cut out the pattern it’s gonna look like this.",teacher,192,4,,,0.0
Don’t cut that across.,student,4,0,,,
"What you’re going to do, keeping the lines on the outside. Don’t fold up the lines on the inside.  You just want to make a fold everywhere that there is a line.  Okay.  So, I folded wherever there was a line and I have something like this. Today we’re not gonna leave a side open.  We’re gonna tape down all of our edges, okay?  You’re gonna see, class, that it would normally look just like we would do before.  You would go ahead and you would fold them up.  And you’ll tape ‘em but you’re gonna have this piece on the top that’s higher, right Student D?  Can you look up here? This piece is gonna be higher.  This is gonna be the lid.  Can you guys see that?  So when you’re all done and you tape the four sides together, just fold the lid down and tape it and in the end you will have this box that’s completely closed. You won’t be able to put anything inside it.  And that’s the plan so that you’ll be able to figure out how many cubic centimeters could go inside it without actually putting them inside it. I have 20 cubic centimeters for each group.  So take a Dixie cup. There’s 20 of these cubic centimeters inside them. Obviously that’s not enough to fill up this whole box but it’s certainly enough for you to use it as a tool to figure out a way to find out what the cubic volume is for this box, okay?  In cubic centimeters. I also put out some centimeter rulers.  They might help you as well. I’d really like to see if people can do this two different ways.  Okay?  Using these and using the rulers.

But I tell you, from making these in the past, guys, I have found it the best way, the most important thing you gotta do at the beginning is when you make these folds, really fold them good on that line.

You guys were very successful at it and you guys.  Everybody found success here.",teacher,65,1,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  It was pretty straightforward.  You guys have been working towards this volume thing very well.  You’re coming in on a Monday after having a couple days off and everybody was able to get right to it without much instruction from me.  You all knew what to do.  You all remembered the formula for finding volume and you looked for ways to use it. All right.  Tell me one way you used it.  We’ll start with you guys. Student J, and Student A, what did you do?",teacher,87,2,,,1.0

"Yep.  Wow, look at that guys.  Hear that math talk going on there.  She’s referring – and I’ve seen this come up, guys. I’ve seen this come up on assessments where they use this word ‘edge’.  And I tried to talk to each group about it because if you don’t know what an edge is and they say, what is the length of this edge, and you’re like wow, what’s an edge?  It’s the easiest question in the world if you just know what an edge is.  And if you don’t know what an edge is, you’re probably not gonna get it. So, say it again.  I’m sorry to interrupt you.  What did you do?",teacher,115,1,1.0,,0.0

Four.,student,1,0,,,
"Four.  And these rulers are a little tricky because you have to slide it up a little bit.  Where that ruler starts that first centimeter or so is kind of dead space on the ruler. You have to be careful there.  And it was four centimeters. So what was your next step then, to calculate the volume?",teacher,57,6,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
Okay.  Multiply them out.  Five times eight was 40 times four. Four times four is 16.  It’s gonna be ten times that because of the zero.  160.  Correct answer?,teacher,29,1,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
No.  100 percent wrong. [Inaudible],student,5,1,,,
"Now when we started this unit we started writing the answer as cubic centimeters and I said, “Write out cubic units if they don’t tell you what the unit is or cubic centimeters.” Today, the official way to really write this, guys, is to write down the unit measurement and then put down a three. An exponent three. So in this case it was centimeters and you put a little three there. That means cubic centimeters.  Okay?  Yeah.  This means centimeters times centimeters times centimeters.  Okay? We’ve done exponents.  Right?  When we talked about this we talked about 10 to the third power or ten cubed.  You remember when we talked about it we said we can call that ten cubed or we can call it ten to the third power.   Most people refer to it as ten cubed because it’s ten times ten times ten and if you think about it, that’s length times width times height.  And that will make a cube that would be ten whatever.",teacher,169,20,0.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Much easier, guys, this is the abbreviation for cubic.  Okay? For volume.  It’s a little easier than writing out cubic centimeters.  You just put a little exponent three up there next to the abbreviation for centimeters.  Okay.  Somebody else.  So that was with the ruler.  What else did somebody else do?  Just talk me through it.  Another way?  What did you guys do?",teacher,63,5,,,1.0

"Okay.  So you used the cubes to figure it out and what did you do?  Listen up, guys.  What did you do?",teacher,22,1,,,1.0
"For the length, we turned it upside down and then you taught us like you don’t want to have like put every cube on there. If one side equals the other side and the other side equals the other side, just do one side, one edge, and then do the other edge and times those two.",student,56,2,,0.0,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
And then that was five and eight and then you got 40 and then we measured the height –,student,19,1,,0.0,

We did another edge and measured four and then we did 40 times two and then that gave us 80 and then we did 80 times two. And it was 160 cubic centimeters.,student,33,2,,0.0,
"Guys, this edge talk is important.  I’ve seen it on the test where the simple question was this.  I think the question said something like this.  Okay?  And it was only a year or two ago on this particular unit.  And the question said, “You can put ten cubic centimeters along the edge of a rectangular prism.  How long is that edge?”  And most of the class didn’t get it right. If I said you could put ten – in this case it’s eight.  Let’s stick with what we’re working on.  Eight cubic centimeters can rest along this edge.  How long is this edge?",teacher,104,5,1.0,,0.0
Eight.,student,1,0,,,

So for you to throw out that number five means you’re just throwing out numbers buddy.",teacher,53,0,,,0.0
12.,student,1,0,,,
"Who says 12?  Well, let’s count ‘em out.  Okay.  We’ll say that that’s your rectangular prism.  I’m gonna go over the edges with this pink piece of chalk and count them off as I go. Okay?  And this is what happens. When I ask this question most kids do say eight and the eight that they were talking about is they looked at one, two, three and four.  And that would be here.  One, two, three and four.  And then they say, I got these ones on the bottom. So they would say five, six, seven and eight.  And they say eight. But they forget something has to connect the top and the bottom, right?  One, two, three four.  So there are four more.  So an eight, nine, ten,  11, 12.  This question is also fair game on your assessment guys.  So they’ve thrown this question out there.  I don’t suspect that they’ll ask you how many faces there are.  You all know that from your surface area or rectangular prisms. But that’s a fair, fair game question to ask how many edges there are in assessment so we need to be good with that.  Everybody set?",teacher,197,6,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  There was one other way that a few students did.  They actually – which I thought was really cool.  I know Student D started it and Student J.  They started by just taking their centimeter paper and they flopped the prism right on top of it and they realized right there that it was eight and they realized that this was five.  And then they turned it on edge and they realized that the third dimension was gonna be four.  And they multiplied out. So just using this and rolling the prism around on it, they were able to get their three dimensions, their length, their width and their height.  They multiplied them out and they got 160 cubic centimeters.  Yes, Student N?",teacher,124,9,,,0.0

"Let’s take a quick look back at our objective and see if we hit it.  Students determine the number of cubic centimeters that fill an unmarked box.  I think that we handled that very well.  Okay. So we’ve talked about it.  I just want to make a chart in our books about this.  Okay?  We talked about when you measure something, the length of something, how we measure it.  We talked about when we measure surface area, how we measure it in squares and square units.  Okay? We haven’t talked too much about weight but we’re gonna put that on our chart and we want to make sure that on our chart we have a clear understanding of how we measure volume.  So, on a fresh piece of paper with today’s date, why don’t we just go ahead at the very top and write, “Units of Measurement.” And I think we need three columns.  And our first column is just gonna say units of length.  Let’s move this along, guys. Come on, Student D, get to a piece of paper and start getting this done.
