Okay.  So let’s draw our eyes up here.  We’re gonna be working on a few things up here today and one of them is our objective we’ll start with.  Who wants to read what we’re gonna do today?  [Inaudible] nice loud voice.,teacher,42,0,,,0.0

Determine the volume of a cubic centimeter of a small prism.,student,11,3,,0.0,
"Okay.  Remember we were talking about prisms with our volume exercises?  So we’re gonna talk about cubic centimeters today.  So, the first thing that we need to think about today is building a box.  So, last week you were building a lot of boxes using cubes this size.  Right?  Does anyone remember what the length of one of these was equal to?  We took a ruler.  What was the length?",teacher,70,7,1.0,,0.0
One inch.,student,2,0,,,
"One inch.  Okay?  So we call these cubic inches.   So, if I took my inch ruler and I held this blue cube up here, to the one inch, does it fit?  It might be a little harder to see back there but this was an inch.  Correct?  Okay. Today, we’re gonna be working with cubes but they’re going to be smaller.  Okay?   Does anyone want to predict what the length might be equal to?  We’ll take a prediction. Student C?",teacher,80,4,,,0.0

Okay.  Two or three centimeters?,teacher,5,1,,,0.0
A half a centimeter?,student,4,1,,,
"A half a centimeter?  So okay, a lot of good predictions.  So we’re gonna figure that out really soon.  Okay?  So we are working with cubic centimeters today.  Okay? First thing we need to do, though, is build a box.  So I asked you, if you have some tape, to have that out.  Want I’m gonna do is have you build a box today but instead of leaving it open you’re actually gonna close it.  Notice that I don’t have a top that folds over. So, when you put your box together with your partner you can in fact tape it.  And if you notice mine, nothing’s flapping open. Right?  So you’re actually making a closed box.   You are going to get a patent so it’ll look familiar?",teacher,128,2,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
What’s the only thing different about this patent compared to your other patents?  Student K?,teacher,15,0,,,1.0
It doesn’t have the grid.,student,5,0,,,
"It doesn’t have the gridlines.  But that’s okay because we had enough practice with patents now that we don’t need the gridlines for this.  What you’re gonna do is cut it out, form it into a box and close it up.  Easy enough?",teacher,43,2,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,

What was that?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"You’re [Inaudible].  Okay.  So one box per pair.  One person can cut.  One person can tape.  You can share tape with another group if you need to. Okay.  So, boys and girls, this should be a pretty quick activity. One person cut it.  Then the other person can fold the tape and it will look like this as the end result.",teacher,61,0,,,0.0

"Not holes.  Gridlines.  Okay?  Before when we were measuring with our cubic inches we had gridlines that matched, didn’t we?  Okay?  Today, I want you to use this size cube.

[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Now, you can use the cubes but here’s the trick.  Or here’s the one exception.  You cannot open up the box and fill ‘em with cubes.  For one, I don’t think we have enough cubes in the room.  So we can’t fill the box.  You are going to have to work together to figure out how to figure out the volume without opening the box.  Okay? So I’m gonna give you cubes and I’m gonna give you one more tool. I’m gonna give you a ruler.  How many of you have used the rulers with the double sides?  Okay?  Centimeters and inches?  You may use this and a cube and see if you can figure out the volume of this box. Questions for me?  Okay.  You may get started.  You all have cubes. As soon as you’re ready, you can get started. So how are you guys thinking about [Inaudible]?  What are you thinking [Inaudible]?  Okay.  Go ahead.  What exactly do you want to measure on the box?",teacher,168,12,,,0.0

But now I want to know what these represent as far as [Inaudible]. So, let’s take [Inaudible] now and see if that will help you answer it.  Okay? Student J?  [Inaudible].   So I see what you’re doing and I’m not trying to [Inaudible] but how can we do the same thing you were just doing but on the outside.  Right?  [Inaudible] That’s exactly what [Inaudible] did.

What I’m more curious about today is the process that helped you to get to the volume. I know that everyone in here knows how to multiply.  So what I really want to hear about now is strategies that were used.  Okay? So, before we get that final answer, by a show of hands, how many of you in your pairs were able to find the volume of this box? Hold on.  Let me finish.  Find the volume of the box using the cube?

Now, I’m gonna ask right now if you still are fiddling with the cubes, that we make our hands free.  Okay.  We don’t need to do any more building now.
