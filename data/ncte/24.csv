"All right.  So we’re running.  Today in math, let’s look at the objective.  Students will be able to use doubling and halving strategies to solve multiplication problems.  So do we remember our doubling and halving strategies?  Put your hand up if you remember them.  Okay.  I want us to look at two problems.  Now, I don’t want us to solve these problems.  I just want you to look at them.  Just look at these problems.  Now, what do we know about these problems? What can someone tell me about these two multiplication problems that we’re going to know, Student K?",teacher,100,2,,,1.0
They’ve got 16 in them.,student,5,0,,,
"One of the factors is 16.  So from both of the problems, one of the factors is 16.  Awesome, Student K.  Student S?",teacher,23,2,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"The 16 is the same, so yep, the same factors.  So both multiplication problems have 16 as one of the factors. Good.  Student J?",teacher,24,3,,,0.0
"6, 3 is half of 3.",student,6,0,,,
3 is half of 6. Good.  Student M?,teacher,8,0,1.0,,0.0
3 doubled to get 6.,student,5,0,,,
"If you double 3, you’ll get 6.  If you cut 6 in half, you’ll get 3.  So, real quick, what I want you to do – I’m going to give you about 30 seconds – turn to the person sitting next to you, or Student L, you can just walk over and sit with Student T real quick, and talk about how you can represent 16 times 3 or 16 times 6 in a story problem or as a picture.  If you were going to draw this, or if you were going to write it in a story problem, tell them the story problem you would write, or tell them how you would draw a picture for either one of these two problems.  I’m going to give you about 30 seconds. [0:02:30] Would you draw it or would you do a story problem?",teacher,143,0,1.0,,0.0
I would do both.,student,4,0,,,
All right.  So what would one of your story problems be for 16 times 3?,teacher,15,0,,,1.0
"There are 16 students, and the students have to match up in 3 groups of 16?",student,16,0,,0.0,
"So if you had 16 students and you were breaking them up into groups, would that be division or multiplication, for putting them into groups?",teacher,25,2,1.0,,1.0
"Oh, division.",student,2,1,,,
So is that a division problem?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
"Yeah, or no.",student,3,0,,,
"No, it’s multiplication.  So how can you change that around to be a multiplication problem?",teacher,15,2,,,1.0
"Well, since remember I said that, like, division –",student,9,1,,0.0,
So you have 16 students.  So you could say each student has –,teacher,13,0,0.0,,0.0
Three pencils.,student,2,0,,,
Three pencils.  So what would your question be in that story problem?,teacher,12,0,,,1.0
How many pencils in all?,student,5,0,,,
In all.  Awesome.  So Student M?,teacher,6,0,1.0,,0.0
"If I was making a story problem, my story problem would be, I have 16 students in the class.  Each student has 3 pockets. How many pockets all together?",student,29,0,,0.0,
Pockets in their pants?,teacher,4,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Cool.  All right.  So let’s get back together.  I heard some really good [inaudible] from Students L and M.  So, who can share with me a story problem that they would have for one of these problems, a story problem they can make up? Student J?",teacher,46,0,,,0.0
I have 16 boxes.  They each have three applies in them.  How many apples in all?,student,16,0,,0.0,
"Awesome.  So, what I’m picturing is 16 boxes in my head, like Student J said.  So 12, 13, 14, 15 – and how many apples did you put in each box?",teacher,31,0,1.0,,0.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
"Three apples.  So then he asked – what was your final question, Student J?",teacher,14,0,,,0.0
How many apples in all.,student,5,0,,,
"How many apples in all?  So, multiplication problem or division problem?",teacher,11,2,1.0,,0.0
Multiplication.,multiple students,1,1,,,
"Exactly.  It was a multiplication problem; that’s what we wanted.  Awesome, Student J.  So rather than counting all of these apples, what’s a shortcut for adding, Student T? What’s our shortcut for adding?",teacher,33,1,,,0.0
Multiplication.,student,1,1,,,
"Multiplication.  So rather than adding 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 until we’re done, we can just multiply 16 times 3, because we have 16 boxes.  Student J, can you sit right there next to Student C?  All right.  Now, so we have the story problem and we drew a picture.  Who can tell me something they know about the product?  Remember, the product is the answer to a multiplication problem.  What are we going to know about the products of these two multiplication problems?  Student S?",teacher,90,7,,,0.0
It’s going to [inaudible].,student,4,0,,,
It’s going to what?  What is going to be [inaudible] the other one?  Which one is going to be double?,teacher,20,0,,,0.0

"Say it a little louder, Student B?",teacher,7,0,,,0.0
That is.,student,2,0,,,
"Which one?  The top answer is going to be double this answer? How many people agree that this answer is going to be double of this answer?  So say this answer – let’s pretend that this answer was 5, which is isn’t, but let’s pretend – this answer is going to be double 5; this answer is going to be 10.  How many people agree with that?  How many people think that it’s going to be something else?  All right.  Who thinks it’s going to be maybe something else? Student J?  So you disagree?  What do you think?",teacher,98,0,,,1.0
I think that the first [inaudible] double answer [inaudible].,student,9,0,,0.0,
"So you think that 16 times 6, its answer, its product is going to be double what the product of this is?",teacher,22,2,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"So if this answer was 5 – which it isn’t, but let’s pretend that it is – that this would be double, so this one would be 10?",teacher,28,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Why do you think that, Student J?",teacher,7,0,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"Yeah.  Remember our doubling and halving?  If one factor stays the same – did we have one factor stay the same, Student K?",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
What factor stayed the same?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
16.,student,1,0,,,
"16.  So if we have one factor stay the same and one factor is doubled, did one of these factors get doubled?",teacher,22,1,,,1.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"What factor got doubled, Student M?",teacher,6,0,,,0.0
3.,student,1,0,,,
"3 got doubled to 6.  So we doubled 3 into 6, then my answer will be doubled, so my answer needs to be double.  So I’m going to go from 5, I’m going to double 5 to get to 10. So, let’s actually solve this and see what’s going to happen.  Let’s solve this and see what’s going to happen. Do I know my 16s tables?",teacher,66,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  So, how can I solve 16 times 3?  What am I going to have to do?  What’s a strategy I can use, Student C?",teacher,25,0,,,0.0
You can break up the 16.,student,6,0,,,
"Awesome.  I like it.  So if I have 16 times 3, what am I going to break up the 16 into?  What groups?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,0.0
10.,student,1,0,,,
10 and –?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
6.,student,1,0,,,
"6.  Awesome.  So I’m going to get rid of my 16.  I’m going to have a group of 10 and a group of 6.  So how many new multiplication problems am I going to have, Student T?",teacher,37,1,,,0.0
Two.,student,1,0,,,
Two.  Can you give me one of them?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
3 times 10.,student,3,0,,,

"My plus sign.  Does it go here, here, or here?",teacher,10,0,,,0.0
The middle.,student,2,0,,,
The middle.  All right?  So let’s solve this.  3 times 10 is –?,teacher,13,0,,,0.0
30.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"30.  Remember, we’ve got to drop our plus sign down.  3 times 6 is –?",teacher,15,0,,,0.0
18.,multiple students,1,0,,,
18.  So we need to add 30 plus 18.  Student K?,teacher,11,1,,,0.0
48.,student,1,0,,,
"48.  30 plus 18 – 0 and 8 is 8, 3 and 1 is 4.  48.  So, if we know that 16 times 3 is 48, 16 times 3 is 48, what’s that going to be.  What’s the product of 16 times 6 going to be, Student L?",teacher,48,1,,,0.0
It’s gonna be – we’re doubling – we’re adding 16 again?,student,11,0,,0.0,
"We’re not adding 16 again.  Remember over here.  If one factor stays the same and one factor is doubled – so we doubled, we went from 3 to 6, we doubled 3 – then our answer will –?",teacher,38,0,1.0,,0.0
Double.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Double.  So we know we need to double –?,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
48.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"48.  How do we double 48?  We can do it two ways.  Student R, what’s one way you can double 48?",teacher,21,0,,,1.0
"8 plus 8.  I mean, 4 plus 4 and that’s 8.",student,11,0,,0.0,
Where are you getting the 4 from?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,0.0
The 4 [inaudible].,student,3,0,,,
Oh.  So add 4 plus 4?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
40 plus 40. Put an 8 with that. Was she trying to say –?,student,14,0,,0.0,
Why?  What two numbers are you adding together?  You’re just adding 4 together?,teacher,13,0,0.0,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"So if I double 48, what’s one way I can double 48?  I can use addition but what – no, if I do 4 plus 4 – so 4 plus 4 is 8.  That’s double 48?  Hold on.  No, she’s almost there. Give her a second.",teacher,46,1,,,0.0
Do 4 plus 4 and then do 8 plus 8.,student,10,0,,0.0,
Hold on.  But what numbers do I need to add together?  What’s the total number that I need to add?,teacher,20,3,1.0,,0.0
48.,student,1,0,,,
48 plus –?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
48.,student,1,0,,,
"48.  Thank you.  Because when you say it that way I was kind of confused, and I’m sure some of the kids in the class were confused.  So you can double 48 by adding 48 plus 48.  How else can you double 48?  Student J?",teacher,45,0,,,1.0
48 times 2.,student,3,0,,,
48 times 2.  So either way would work.  Okay?  Either way would work.  So which one’s going to be easier?  Student K?,teacher,22,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"I think 48 plus 48, because I don’t know my 48 tables.  We’d have to break it apart.  So 8 plus 8 is –?",teacher,24,0,,,1.0
16.,multiple students,1,0,,,
16.  40 plus 40 is –?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
80.,multiple students,1,0,,,
80.  So now let’s add 16 plus 80.  6 plus 0 is –?,teacher,13,1,,,0.0
6.,multiple students,1,0,,,
1 plus 8 is –?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
9.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"96.  Student C?  All right.  Go sit at the back table.   So just because you guys aren’t on camera doesn’t mean that you still need to do the math work, okay?  Just because you’re not on camera doesn’t mean that you can just sit here. All right.  One factor stayed the same, one factor doubled, answer doubled.  Or you could look at it this way:  one factor stayed the same, one factor was cut in half – we cut it in half, we got 3 – so our answer’s going to get cut in half.  Right?  Can’t you look at it the other way, too?",teacher,105,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Sure.  So one thing that – real quick, before we break out and do some problems – one thing that I wanted us to look at was an array.  Did anyone, when you were talking to your friend, say, “I would represent it as an array”?  So who can come up and draw a 16 by 3 array?  Student J.  Ever? The whole year you’ve never gone up on the board?  Come on.",teacher,73,4,,,0.0
"[Inaudible] in the third grade what we used to do is use, like, we used to count numbers, the higher numbers and then the 1s table.  So what she was trying to say is, instead of just adding 48 and 48, she was just trying to say add 4 and 4, which is like –",student,55,1,,0.0,
So she meant add the 4 from here and the 4 from here?,teacher,13,1,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"But are we really adding 4 and 4, Student D?",teacher,10,0,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
No.  You’re adding what?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
We’re adding 40 and 40.,student,5,0,,,
40 and 40.  Not 4 and 4.  Good.,teacher,8,0,1.0,,0.0

"Ooh.  What’s the name of that?  Without all the lines – good, Student J.  Do you know the name of it, because you did it? Call it un–?  Not unknown.  Un–.",teacher,31,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
Unm—,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
Unmarked.,student,1,0,,,
"Unmarked array.  Good.  So this is an unmarked array because we don’t have all the squares on the inside.  All right.  So who can come up and draw a 16 by 6 array?  A 16 by 6 array. So we had a girl go up so we’ll have Student J go up, because we had a girl.",teacher,57,5,,,0.0
16 by what?,student,3,0,,,
So now when you do this you want to make sure that – see how we have a 16 here?  So you want to have 16 [inaudible]. Awesome.  How did we do?,teacher,32,0,,,1.0
Good.,student,1,0,,,
"Good.  So I just want to make sure – I’m just going to make this one a little bit shorter, okay?  Now, how many of these arrays – it’s not drawn perfectly, because we didn’t get out the ruler and all that stuff to measure out and make it perfect – but how many of these arrays could fit in this array?  Just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?  How many?  If I took this array – if I had a couple of these – how many could I put so that they fit perfectly over this one?  Remember we played the game “Big Array, Small Array,” where we were matching the small arrays on top of the bigger array?",teacher,119,10,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So how many of these small arrays do you think could fit perfectly on top of this one?  1, 2, 3, 4 – how many do you think?  Two.  Why do you think two, Student O?",teacher,36,1,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"So look at the top, going across the top, our rows.  Are these going to fit perfectly with these rows going this way?",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah, because they have 16 going across each row.  Now let’s go down the columns.  How many are going to fit perfectly? You said 2, right?  So why are 2 going to fit and take up this one space of 6?  Why are 2 going to fit right here on top of this 6?",teacher,54,0,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
You want some help?  All right.  Call on someone to help you. So you were right:  2 are going to fit.  But why?  Why? Student J?,teacher,26,0,,,1.0
Because 3 plus 3 equals 6.,student,6,0,,,
"Yeah.  So if we cut this in half, this 3 by 6 array is going to fit right here.  This 3 by 16 array is going to fit right here, and 3 plus 3 equals 6, right, Student O?  So, or 3 times 2.  Good.  But this is going to be 3, because if it was really like – we would have 1, 2, 3 and then 1, 2, 3. Can you see that?  So it’s 3 here, and 3 here, and they would both make up 6.  Does that make sense?  Everyone, does that make sense?  I don’t think I really did a good job of explaining that.  All right?  So, what we’re going to look at is one more thing, and we’re not even going to solve the problem.  I just want you to see what you think the answer is going to be.  So if I wrote this problem – all right, raise your hand if you think that the product of this multiplication is going to be bigger than this one. Raise your hand if you think this is going to be bigger than this?  So a couple. Raise your hand if you think this one is going to be less than this. So you think this problem is going to be less than the product of this problem?  Raise your hand if you think that both products are going to be the same.  Raise your hand if you’re not sure.  All right.  So let’s have a vote.  How many people think that this product is going to be bigger? So we have two.  How many people think that this product is going to be the bigger number?  We have two.  How many people think that the products are going to be the same? Three, four, five people.  And how many aren’t sure?  Six? One, two, three, four – we’ve got about five.  Now, look at our rules.  Student L, read the first rule.  No [inaudible] any rules.",teacher,332,9,1.0,,1.0

"If one factor stays the same and one factor is half, my answer will be half.",student,16,0,,0.0,
"All right.  So now that we know these rules, let’s go through it again.  How many people think that this is going to be the bigger product, that this multiplication problem is going to give us a bigger product than this?  All right. How many people think that this is going to give us a bigger product?  So two.  And how many people think they’re going to be same now.  Ooh.  So why are they going to be the same, Student M?",teacher,82,4,0.0,,1.0
Because it says [inaudible].,student,4,0,,,
So which factor got doubled?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
15.,student,1,0,,,
The 15 got doubled to what?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
30.,student,1,0,,,
30.  Good.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
8 got split in half.,student,5,0,,,
And 8 got split in half.  So if one factor is doubled – from 15 to 30 – and the other factor is split in half – 8 to 4 – what happens?,teacher,33,0,1.0,,1.0

12.  Then I have to do what?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0

120.  So have we got the same answer?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,

Same answer.,multiple students,2,0,,,
Student D?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
"At first I know it was 120 once I saw the problem, because 15 and 30 are halves, [inaudible] doubled, and [inaudible] 15 times 8 and [inaudible] 30 times 4, because 8 and 4 is doubled.",student,36,0,,1.0,
"Well, you look at it this way:  double 40 at 8, then cut 30 in half.  So you could look at it that way, too, couldn’t you? So Student D looked at it the other way.  We said 15 got doubled and 8 got cut in half.  Student D looked at it as 30 got cut in half and 4 got doubled.  So you could look at it either way.  Do you see that, that you can look at it either way?",teacher,82,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Sure.  So that’s good, Student D.  I’m glad that you brought that up.  So what we’re going to do – hold on, Student J – is we’re going to look at these problems.  So on the front we have inches and yards conversions, but before we do that, I want you to look at the back.  So we’re going to do page 62 first, okay?  What it is is some multiplication problems.  We can use the break-apart method.  Sure.  But I also want to see maybe for one or two of them, try to use doubling and halving.",teacher,98,2,,,0.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
"I know we can do the break-apart method, so if you look at it and you’re not sure if you can double or halve it to get the answer, but try.  Maybe for one or two, try to double and halve.  But if you don’t think that’s right, maybe you can check it.  So you can do the break-apart for some, but for at least one try and double and halve it to get your answer, okay?",teacher,77,0,,,0.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
So can I have Student L and Student J pass these out please? We’re doing page 61 first.  I mean 62.  Sorry.,teacher,22,0,,,0.0
"If both of the factors are doubled, that means it’s the same.",student,12,1,,1.0,
"No.  If both factors are doubled, that doesn’t mean it’s going to be the same.",teacher,15,1,1.0,,0.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
One factor needs to be doubled.  The other one needs to be halved to be the same.,teacher,17,0,,,0.0
"Oh.  So doubling 4 – 4 and 4.  No.  4 and 4 equals 8, and 15 times 2 is 30.",student,20,0,,0.0,
"Yeah, but, if we double both of them it would be 15 times 4 would then equal 30 times 8.  That’s doubling both, but we wouldn’t end up with the same answer.  This doesn’t [inaudible].  So when we double and halve, we’re only doing one of the factors.  So when one factor is doubled and one is halved, we get the same answer.  When one stays the same and the other one’s doubled, our answer is going to be doubled, and when one stays the same and the other one’s cut in half, our answer is going to be half.  Okay?",teacher,101,1,1.0,,0.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
"So if you get confused, just look here.  Yep.  So we’re doing page 62 first.  So do these multiplication problems.  If you need to use the break-apart, do it, but try to use this rule.  If one factor is double and one factor is half, my answer will be the same.  Try to do that for one of them. So pick one and try to do that.  Let’s go, Student D.  Got a pencil?",teacher,74,1,,,0.0
Yeah.  My lead pencils.,student,4,0,,,
"That’s fine. Okay.  So we’re just solving these multiplication problems, but what we were going over is that if one factor is doubled and the other factor is cut in half, we’re going to end up with the same answer.

"So, do you know your 16s tables?  No.  Actually, for number 4 and 5, I want you to double and halve those ones.  Those ones are really good to double and halve.  So even if you solved it using the break-apart method, solve it twice. No, you don’t need to erase it, but next to it, solve it using our doubling and halving rule, because you should get the same answer.  You don’t need to erase.  For 4 and 5 – 4 and 5 are going to be really good ones.  Then 6, 7, 8 you can use the break-apart method. But we can solve it a different way.
