We’re gonna get to this last one in a minute, but not right now.  okay, so we’re gonna use some of these blocks.

If you think you can find an equivalent fraction, raise your hand and we’ll see what you come up with. So we’re gonna start with a little easy one.  How about this one right here?

"So if you get them right, you can give yourself a check.  If they’re wrong, you can either erase it and fix it or you can just put the right answer underneath, okay?  So if you boys want to start with a different one maybe, ‘cause they might be using the same colors, it’s up to you.  Or you can just do them all together in order, okay?",teacher,68,0,,,0.0

"Hmm?  Okay.  Really, what I want you to do is just make a guess, okay?  And then when we use the blocks you’ll start to understand why this is gonna be less than that, okay? So just pick – pick a symbol for now and just put it inside and you can start to check, okay?",teacher,56,0,,,0.0

"Okay.  Student W, you come over here and sit in Student M’s seat and you can start checking them with that group. Here, bring your paper.

So the first one is three-fifths, so you want to find the fifths right here, okay?  Here’s three-fifths, right?  One, two, three, that’s what we need, okay?  Now we’re gonna find two-thirds.  You want to find – here’s one-third.  You need one more.  Okay, so this is two-thirds.  We’ll put it over here.  Three-fifths, two-thirds.  What do you think?
