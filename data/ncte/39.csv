"Okay, today’s activity is comparing fractions.  This is a revisit.  Ladies and gentlemen, next week you will be having your math unit exam, okay?  So today is the day. Speak now or forever hold your peace.  If there’s something that you do not understand, we need to work that out today, because on Monday you will be having an exam, okay? Now today’s activity, if you notice on the sheet, it says, you may know how to compare fractions, which I know you do, but what we normally do is we find a common denominator when we compare fractions.  Well, I’m going to ask you today not to do that.  We need to figure out another strategy that we can use to compare fractions.  And we need to determine in that comparison, which fraction is larger and which fraction is smaller. So on your activity sheet, it says here, I want you to compare fractions using diagrams.  Well, I’m going to give you a hint.  Normally when we use diagrams, we have been using circles, and what have we been calling these circles that we use?",teacher,186,11,,,0.0
Pie.,student,1,0,,,
Slices of pie.  What if I do something like this?  What would this be called?  What is that box named?  What do we call that box?,teacher,26,0,,,1.0
An array.,student,2,1,,,
"An array.  I’m going to ask you to compare fractions using an array, okay?  And the reason why I’m asking you to use an array is because it’s a lot easier to determine the size of the piece using this type of array than it is using this. Okay?  This becomes a little bit more tricky to eyeball and judge the size.  But I can make two arrays that are basically the same shape or the same size.  I have a hard time making two circles that are the same size, okay? So I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to not do the common denominators for this activity, okay?  It says here, using diagrams determine which fraction in each pair is larger. For the first one, we have five-ninths or seven-ninths, the second one we have two-fifths or two-sevenths, the third one, three-fourths or five-sixths, and the fourth one, five- eighths or four-ninths. Ladies and gentlemen, after you compare all of these fractions, I want you to determine for each set what rule you can use to determine when you have fractions that are similar.  What rule can you use for every single fraction that’s similar to the two that you’re comparing?  Okay?  So you’re going to look at this first set and then determine a rule that you could use for the first set.  Then the second set, you’re going to look at those, and when you find which one is larger, think of a rule you can use if you have other fraction sets that are similar, okay? You have math paper in front of you.  I want you guys to do some collaborative learning, so you’re going to be talking at your tables as you do this, okay?  Are there any questions so far?  No questions?  Okay, well have at it, have fun. I’m going to come around and listen to some of your discussion as you talk, okay? So the first one is five-ninths or seven-ninths.  So you’re comparing.  And you’re going to determine in the box which one is larger.  Is it this one, or is it this one?  Okay? And then you’re going to determine a rule.  What rule can I come up with for a set of fractions that I might have that are similar?  And this rule should work for every single fraction that’s similar that you have to do comparisons for.   Yeah, talk in your groups. I see you circled one.  Why is that one larger?  Talk to your tablemates.  Why?  Why do you believe that’s larger?",teacher,428,16,,,0.0
Because 7…,student,2,0,,,
"I notice that your table make here, Student N, drew an array, and she colored in some pieces of that array.  Why does that work?",teacher,25,2,,,1.0
"Because when the denominators are the same, you can look at the denominator and determine which one’s larger.",student,18,2,,1.0,
So when the denominators are the same you can look at the denominators to determine?,teacher,15,2,1.0,,1.0
The numerators.,student,2,1,,,
"So when the denominators are the same, what do I do?",teacher,11,1,,,0.0
You look at the numerator and you can compare the numbers to get which one is larger.,student,17,1,,1.0,
"Oh, I love that.  Because these denominators are the same you’re saying I can look at the numerator to determine the larger fraction.",teacher,23,3,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"And because this numerator is larger, this fraction is larger, because they have the same denominator, is that what you’re telling me?",teacher,22,3,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Do you guys agree with that?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"So can you use this, and do you think it will work for every single fraction whose denominators are the same, do you think that rule would work for every set of fractions? Let’s say I’m dealing with four-fifths and three-fifths. Could you use that rule that you just told me to determine which one of these is the larger?",teacher,60,3,,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
So that rule will hold true.  And why does this work again?,teacher,12,0,,,1.0
"Because when the denominators are the same, you can look at the numerators and you can tell which one is larger.",student,21,2,,1.0,
Do you agree with her or disagree?,teacher,7,0,0.0,,1.0

"When the denominators are the same, the…",teacher,7,1,1.0,,0.0
The one which is larger in the numerator is the one that [inaudible].,student,13,1,,1.0,
"Okay, so I’m looking at two fractions here, five-ninths and seven-ninths, and they have the same denominator.  So you’re saying because they have the same denominator don’t even worry about the denominators, then look to the numerator?",teacher,37,5,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"And I’m looking at the numerators, and what am I looking for?",teacher,12,1,,,0.0
The one with the larger numerator.,student,6,1,,,
"The fraction with the largest numerator, and that’s the larger fraction.  And you’re saying it’s larger because the denominators are the same?",teacher,22,4,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Why is that?  Why does that work?,teacher,7,0,,,1.0
"Because when the denominators are the same, it’s like you cut it into the same pieces.",student,16,1,,1.0,
"Well, can you show that to me in a diagram?  Can you show me? Can you prove that in a picture?  Because I hear your words, but maybe I need to see it to believe it. Okay, so I notice Student K has two arrays that are the same size.",teacher,50,1,0.0,,1.0
Can we do number lines?,student,5,1,,,
"Are you asking me?  Baby, you can do whatever your little heart desires.  If you can prove to me why that works, go on ahead. So I’m looking at Student K’s arrays.  She’s got two arrays of the same size, and I see seven-ninths has a larger shaded portion than five-ninths.  And I see in each of her arrays she’s divided them into nine pieces.  Why are there nine pieces here and why are their nine pieces here?",teacher,78,4,0.0,,1.0
Because the denominator is [nine].,student,5,1,,,
And what does the denominator tell us?,teacher,7,1,1.0,,0.0
How many pieces you have in total.,student,7,1,,,
How many pieces are in total?  And how many slices in total are taken from the total?  How many slices are used here?,teacher,23,3,1.0,,0.0
Five.,student,1,0,,,
Five out of the nine.  And here we’ve used how many?,teacher,11,0,,,0.0
Seven.,student,1,0,,,
"Seven out of the nine.  Okay, so that’s why it would be bigger, or larger.  Okay, so seven-ninths is greater than five- ninths.",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Look at B and have a discussion with B.  And Student M asked if she could use a number line, and I’m anxious to see what you’re going to do with B on a number line, Student M, so I’m going to come back to you, okay? Okay, what can you guys tell me?",teacher,54,2,,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
What was that?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Seven-ninths is bigger than five-ninths.,student,5,0,,,
"Seven-ninths is larger than five-ninths; it’s greater than, mm- hmm.",teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0
"When the denominator is the same, you can use the top, the numerator, you can see which one is bigger.",student,20,2,,1.0,
"Okay, when the denominators are the same you can look at the numerator, and whichever numerator is larger, than that is the larger fraction?",teacher,24,4,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"And I see you drew a diagram that shows that.  My question is, what’s the rule that goes along with fraction set A?",teacher,23,1,,,0.0
"Every time the denominator is the same, you look at the numerator to see which one is bigger.",student,18,2,,1.0,
"Oh, I love you, Student I.  Okay so here’s what I want you guys to do.  And do you agree with him?",teacher,22,0,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, so look at fraction set B.  Two-fifths or two-sevenths. Come up with a rule for that after you look at that and draw a diagram for that and tell me what rule you’re going to come up with for set B, and I’ll be back. Okay, oh wow, you guys are like rolling, huh?  Set A, I see that you guys said seven-ninths is the larger fraction.  And I see through Lynn’s diagram, she drew two arrays that are the exact same size and she shaded in five out of nine on the first array, and seven out of nine on the second array. And I can really see that seven-ninths is larger than five- ninths.  And her rule, she says the same denominator but different numerator, look to the bigger numerator.  Seven is bigger than five, therefore seven-ninths is larger.  Do you guys agree or disagree?",teacher,148,8,,,0.0
Agree.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, look at Set B.  Two-fifths or two-sevenths?  Let me see your diagram?  Where’s your diagram for B?  Remember what I said, any time I give you something I am challenging you to turn on that think box in your head.",teacher,41,0,,,0.0
My think box is full.,student,5,0,,,
"Well, you just fed your think box.  Did anybody draw a diagram for Set B?  I’m anxious to see.  I was just talking to Student V’s table.  What did you guys come up with?",teacher,34,0,1.0,,1.0
"[Inaudible] figure out, but I know that seven-ninths is bigger.",student,10,0,,1.0,
You know that seven-ninths is bigger.  And why do you know that seven-ninths is bigger?,teacher,15,0,1.0,,1.0
"The denominator is the same, so that means the whole amount is the same.",student,14,2,,1.0,
"So they’re each dealing with nine of whatever, okay.",teacher,9,0,0.0,,0.0
And seven is greater than five.,student,6,0,,,
"Okay, can you show me that in an array?",teacher,9,1,0.0,,1.0
I did an array.,student,4,1,,,
What did you do?,teacher,4,0,,,1.0
"I put all the ninths that equal seven-ninths, and then all the ninths that equals five-ninths.  And then seven-ninths had more one-ninths.  So obviously this one is greater.",student,28,0,,1.0,
"But why were you able to do one-ninth, one-ninth, one-ninth, one-ninth, one-ninth to both of them?",teacher,16,0,1.0,,1.0
Because it says nine right here.,student,6,0,,,
What’s that number right there?  What is that number called?,teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0
The denominator.,student,2,1,,,
"The denominator, yes, yes.  So because the denominators are the same you are able to just break this into ninths and that into ninths.  How many ninths did you use for this one?",teacher,33,2,,,0.0
Seven.,student,1,0,,,
How many ninths did you use for this one?,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Five.,student,1,0,,,
"Five.  Now, I want to know, Student E, can you draw a picture? Let me try.  Do they look about the same?",teacher,22,0,,,1.0
Mm-hmm.,student,1,0,,,
"Now, what if I split this into nine equal portions?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  So I don’t need this.  Let’s do this again.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.  So this was seven-ninths and this was five-ninths.  Can we see which one is bigger here?",teacher,53,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"A lot of times too it might seem a little more complicated than it is, so you already proved to me here that you understood the importance of the denominator, and I think just thinking about ways you can represent that in a diagram.  I drew two equal sized diagrams because they’re both dealing with ninths.  So I have ninths in both diagrams.  And on this diagram I chose to shade in five of the ninths, and on this diagram I chose to shade in seven of the ninths.  So can you see here which one is larger?",teacher,98,1,,,0.0
"This one, seven-ninths.",student,3,0,,,
"Okay, so what rule can I come up with for this?  What rule?",teacher,13,0,,,0.0
"If the denominator is the same for both fractions, then either one numerator is greater, the numerator that’s bigger than the other numerator, the one that’s bigger is the biggest.",student,30,5,,1.0,
"So the bigger numerator is a larger fraction because both of the denominators are the same.  Okay.  So the rule is, when both denominators are the same, the fraction with the largest numerator is the larger fraction.  That’s what you’re saying, right?",teacher,42,7,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Gotcha.  Now, look at Set B.  Gentlemen, look at Set B and tell me what diagram do you come up with for Set B, and what rule can you come up with for Set B?  What rule? Which one’s larger for A?",teacher,42,0,,,0.0
Seven-ninths.,student,1,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,,,1.0
"Because the denominators are the same, so you have to look at the numerator.",student,14,2,,1.0,
"Do you disagree?  I see by your diagram you’ve got that too. So write that rule.  He has it written down.  Where’s your rule? And now I want you guys to look at Set B.  Draw a diagram for Set B and then come up for a rule for Set B. Your tablemates need that.  You guys should be tracking amongst each other. Yes, ma’am?",teacher,65,0,0.0,,0.0
I did it.,student,3,0,,,
"Oh, awesome.  Wow! I know, right? Yes, I’m going to ask if you can come to fifth grade.  Who needs 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade, huh?  That’s beautiful.  Can you draw me a picture for that?  Can you draw a picture for me?",teacher,43,0,,,0.0
Mm-hmm.,student,1,0,,,
"Thank you.  Question.  I visited all the tables, and every single table was able to come up with the rules for A.  How many of you are working through B?  Has anybody made their way to C yet?  Any table?",teacher,40,0,,,0.0
I’m going to.,student,3,0,,,
"So I’m coming around to see what you’ve done with B, and ladies and gentlemen, you have to have a diagram.  You have to, have to, have to, have to, have to have a diagram for B. Yes?",teacher,38,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible] says that five-sixths is larger but I disagree.  I think it’s three-fourths.,student,13,0,,1.0,
"Okay, so did you hear his argument as to why five-sixths would be larger?",teacher,14,0,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
And did he use logos in trying to persuade you?,teacher,10,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"He did?  What was the logic he used?  What did he explain to you?  And see, this is the key.  You need to understand the words that were coming out of his mouth so that you can tell me what he said to you.  So explain it to me, because I don’t know which one it is.",teacher,57,0,,,1.0
"I said that three-fourths was larger, but he said five-sixths is larger.  He said that…",student,15,0,,0.0,
"Okay, we’re trying to determine what?  What are we trying to determine here?  Which fraction is…",teacher,16,1,0.0,,0.0
Larger.,student,1,0,,,
"Which fraction is larger, okay.  And Student K said which one was larger?",teacher,13,1,,,0.0
Five-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
"Five-sixth was larger.  You’re saying three-fourths is larger. Now I’m asking you, why does Student K believe five-sixths is larger?  Tell me why he believes five-sixths is larger, and then I’ll let you tell me why you believe three-fourths is larger.",teacher,41,0,,,1.0
Because I think because…,student,4,0,,,
"No, no, tell me what Student K thinks.  What did Student K say he thought?  He says, “Five-sixths is larger because…” and what did he tell you?",teacher,27,0,,,1.0
"Well, he didn't really explain it that well because then we got confused. He made me confused. No, he [inaudible] but I didn't really understand what he said. Then I made him confused.",student,33,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so do you want to use your argument of logos with me?  I promise you won’t confuse me.",teacher,19,0,1.0,,0.0
I can try to figure it out.,student,7,0,,,
"Hold on, I want to hear what Student K thinks and I’ll ask you.",teacher,14,0,0.0,,0.0
"I think that five-sixths is larger because one-fourth is larger than one-sixth, and that it’s only one away from one whole. This has a smaller number to get towards one whole, and this is bigger.",student,35,2,,1.0,
"Okay, so my question is, can you show me this in a different type of diagram?  Can you show me this on a diagram that could represent both fractions so I can actually see how far away from one one-sixth is, and how far away from one one-fourth is.  What else can you use besides the array and besides the pizza pie?",teacher,62,2,1.0,,1.0
The line.,student,2,1,,,

A number line?,student,3,1,,,
"Yes, a number line.  Show it to me on the number line.  And then you can show it to Student T on the number line, and you can show it to Student D on the number line, you can show it to Student L on the number line, and you can argue your point.  And that was wonderful logos you used.  I am persuaded, sweetie.",teacher,65,5,,,0.0
Technical difficulties would be…,student,4,0,,,
"Technical difficulties would be, yes?",teacher,5,0,,,0.0
I know that we take two pieces out of both of the array.  How can I tell which one is the greater?,student,22,1,,1.0,
"Right.  Because this one, how many pieces?  There’s only five pieces in this array, and there are seven pieces in that array, and they’re both using two pieces, so which one is larger?",teacher,33,2,1.0,,0.0
I’m not sure.,student,3,0,,,
"You’re not sure?  Student D what are your opinions?  What do you think?  You have to be thinking something now.  I want to hear what you think.  I’ve heard Student T, I’ve heard Student N, I’ve heard Student K, but I haven’t heard from you.  Tell me what are you thinking?  I see you drew a diagram, and you drew basically the same one that Student N drew, but can you explain that? What music do I hear?  Hmmm, why did we even touch it? So I’m going to come back.  Use this, sweetie.  You have all this space, use that.  I’m going to come back.  I think Student K is on to something here and I want him to talk to you about what he believes is larger and why.  So he’s drawing a number line, okay?  And Student K basically said we’re dealing with…",teacher,146,1,,,1.0

I could explain that because it’s much more easier.,student,9,0,,1.0,

Student C?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Which rule?,student,2,0,,,

"Yes, the smaller the denominator, the bigger the piece.",student,9,1,,0.0,
"So you’re looking at two-fifths and two-sevenths, you’re comparing those two fractions, and you’re saying when you’re looking at the denominator and it’s bigger, that means the smaller the piece.  So sevenths are going to be a smaller piece, a smaller size, than fifths.  Also, the smaller the denominator, the bigger the piece.",teacher,53,3,1.0,,0.0
Just how we know that one-fifth is bigger than one-seventh.,student,10,0,,1.0,
"One-fifth is bigger than one-seventh.  Why is one-fifth bigger than one-seventh, explain that to me.  You’re absolutely right, but why?",teacher,20,0,1.0,,1.0

We’re talking about two- fifths and two-sevenths, right?",teacher,67,4,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So what do you know about fifths and sevenths?  Oh, hold on. Wait a minute, wait a minute.  What do you know about fifths and sevenths?  And just let me remind you, remember Grandma’s cookies?

It got smaller.,multiple students,3,0,,,
Why is it smaller?,teacher,4,0,,,1.0

"I know two-fifths is bigger because the denominator is smaller and you get a bigger piece.  And I know that one-fifth is bigger than one-seventh, because if you want to share a cookie with five people than seven, because five is less than seven.",student,44,1,,1.0,
"Here, Student I is saying five people will be sharing in this. And he’s saying here, this would be seven people sharing. So, would you rather have to share out of fifths or share out of sevenths?",teacher,37,0,1.0,,1.0

Fifths are larger than sevenths.,student,5,0,,,

"When the denominator is smaller, you get bigger pieces.",student,9,1,,1.0,
"The smaller denominator, the larger the slice.  But what about the numerators?  The numerators are what in this case?  The numerators are the same.  So when the numerators are the same, and the denominators are different, the fraction with the smaller denominator will have the largest sized pieces, as you can see here.  This is a fraction with the smaller denominator so the pieces are larger.  This is the fraction with the larger denominator, so the pieces are smaller. Smaller denominator, larger piece; larger denominator, smaller piece. Look at C, please.  C is a little bit challenging: three-fourths or five-sixths.

If you take away a fourth it’s going to be like this much.  So if it’s bigger, you know if one-fourth is bigger than one-sixth, so it takes away more.",student,64,0,,1.0,

If I’m standing at one and I take away a sixth, it’s not going to take away as much.  So looking at it from this perspective, because fourths are larger than sixths, if you’re missing a fourth, you’re missing a lot more than if you’re missing a sixth.  So what rule?
