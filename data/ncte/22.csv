That’s alright.  So what’s 10 times 23?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0
230?,student,1,0,,,
230.  Yeah.  So what would be twice as big as that?  It’s 230 plus 230.,teacher,15,0,,,0.0
460?,student,1,0,,,
"460.  Very good.  So if this were 23 times 20 it would be 460. Now, your answer is 908, so does that make sense, that your answer is really, really big and this problem isn’t that big?  So somewhere we can tell something went a little bit off here.  Where do you think that might be?",teacher,56,0,,,1.0
The answer?,student,2,0,,,
"The answer’s definitely a little bit off, so let’s see.  Is there a second way we can solve it and maybe find that mistake?  This happens a lot with the algorithm, that when we carry the 1s we just kind of forget where to put those little dashes, or those dashes start getting confusing.  I can see that you have the 6 times 3 is 18 here, and you carried your 1.  6 times 2, 12, right?  And then you put 13.  So you’ve got 13 here and that’s good.  You’ve got your 0 here, below the 8, because you’re doing the 10 times, and 10 times 23 is 230.  So now you’ve got 8 plus 0 is –?",teacher,119,1,,,0.0

"So you have all the right numbers here but those little dashes just kind of got in the way.  Okay?  So I like that you’re starting this one – you’ve got the array going on – but you’re drawing in all the little boxes.  Think that might take awhile?  That’s why we’re trying to do the labeling. If I counted your boxes, how many would you have going down?",teacher,69,1,,,0.0

23.,student,1,0,,,
"23.  All right.  But we’re going to break the 16 into the 10s and the 1s, so we’re going to have 10 up here and the 6 down here.  Do you see that’s still 16?",teacher,35,0,,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
"And we’re going to have our 20 and our 3 over here.  So we’ve got 20 and 3. So now we just have to fill in here.  Rather than drawing in 6 times 20 boxes, we can just do the multiplication with 6 times 20.",teacher,45,1,,,0.0

Okay?  So 200, 120, 30, and 18.  And it’s always important for you to line up your numbers so they make sense here.  Hundreds are with your hundreds, right? So do you want to add that up, and I’ll come back and check?  If you did it right, it should be the same as that one. Okay.  So what is the answer?  I want you to find the answer.
