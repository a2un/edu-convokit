"All right.  Thank you.  All right, boys and girls, we’re going to be [doing] a lot of work from yesterday.  And yesterday we started discussing solids.  And what did we say about solids that were different from polygons?  How did we say they were different?  Student?",teacher,46,1,,,0.0
They had different volume.,student,4,1,,,
They had volume not different volume but they have volume. Volume means they have space in?,teacher,16,4,,,0.0
Inside.,student,1,0,,,
Side.  Where a polygon is flat there is no space inside.  A solid has volume.  So it has how many dimensions?  Not eight.,teacher,23,3,,,0.0
Two?,student,1,0,,,
"Two dimensions?  This has two dimensions?  What kind of figure is this?  I think you’re not listening to the question.  I didn’t ask how many faces it had, I didn’t have any sides it had, I asked how many dimension.  We know a polygon has how many dimensions?  Polygon.  Student?",teacher,50,6,,,0.0
Two.,student,1,0,,,
"Two.  Length and width.  How many dimensions does a solid have, Student?",teacher,12,2,,,0.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
"Three.  Length, width and?",teacher,4,1,,,0.0
Height.,student,1,0,,,
Height.  So we call this what kind of a figure?,teacher,10,0,,,1.0
Three dimension.,student,2,1,,,
Three dimensional figure or 3D.  Remember yesterday we compared it to a movie?  And we said a 2D movie is usually what we go and see.  It’s a flat screen.  What happens when we see a three dimensional movie?  3D movie?,teacher,41,2,,,0.0
It pops out at you.,student,5,0,,,
"It pops out at you.  It’s like a solid pops out at you.  So yesterday, boys and girls, we talked about the words that we use when we describe the solids to each other.  We came up with lots of different words, we came up with lots of different words to describe what the shape of it was.  Some of you said it had squares, some said triangular.  Then we talked about three important words.  Math vocabulary words. What were the three mathematical terms that I said we wanted to use?",teacher,91,1,1.0,,0.0

Corner or a point.,student,4,0,,,
"Corner or a point.  So the vertices, Student, are the corners. Right?  What if I talked about faces, if I talked about the faces what am I talking about?  Student.",teacher,30,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
The flat surface.  Right?  And what if I’m talking about the edges?  What am I talking about?,teacher,17,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"The lines that are made by vertices right?  Look up here Student.  Two edges meet they form a [vertice].  So the edges are made by corners.  So it’s like this.  This is the edge. So today, boys and girls, you are going to be working in the same groups as yesterday so when I ask you to move I’m gonna have you move, put the chairs in the same positions as yesterday, and you’re each gonna get a bag with the solids and you are going to choose different solids and tell me how many vertices it has, how many faces it has and how many edges it has.  We’re going to look for the number of vertices, faces and edges.  Those three things. So if I’m talking about a cube and I wanted to know how many faces it had what would I be looking at?  Student?",teacher,148,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"The flat surfaces.  Right?  Can you come up?  Can you model and show the class how many faces this figure has?  So first what did she do?  She went one, two, three, four.  What did she do first?  Hold it?  What did she do first?",teacher,45,0,,,1.0
She counted all the faces that go around it.,student,9,0,,0.0,
She counted the ones that go around.  She knew that there were four that go around.  Is that all the faces Student?  What else?  So then she counted what?,teacher,29,0,1.0,,1.0
Top and bottom.,multiple students,3,0,,,
Top and bottom.  So how many total?  Six faces total.  Very good.  Can somebody come up and tell me how many vertices this figure has?  Student.  What are the vertices?  Louder. The corners.  Come on up.  We gotta speak loud and clear because everyone in the room wants to hear.  So what are we gonna look at?,teacher,57,2,,,0.0
"One, two, three, four.",student,4,0,,,
"Okay, so he counted the corners on the?",teacher,8,0,,,0.0
Top.,multiple students,1,0,,,

"Five, six, seven, eight.",student,4,0,,,
Then he had to count the corners on the?,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Bottom.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Bottom.  So how many vertices?  How many vertices Student? Eight.  Now if I were to ask you – we talked about vertices, we talked about faces, now I want to talk about edges.  Edges are a little bit more tricky.  You have to really pay attention to the ones that you’ve already counted.  You’ve gotta keep track.  So I want somebody who knows how they can keep track of what they’re counting efficiently.  Student?",teacher,74,0,,,0.0
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.",student,12,0,,0.0,
"Very good.  Did anybody see how he kept track?  What he counted?  What did he do?  How did you keep track of them? Because 12 edges is a lot, how did you keep track of how many edges there were?",teacher,40,0,1.0,,1.0
I would take the top part and then I would go to the bottom.,student,14,0,,0.0,
"So he counted the top edges, traced his fingers around and saw four, then he counted the middle edges and then he counted the?",teacher,24,0,1.0,,0.0
Bottom edges.,multiple students,2,0,,,
So sometimes it makes sense to work from the top of the solid to the?,teacher,15,0,,,0.0
Bottom.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Bottom.  Some students I’ve seen like to count the top.  They know the top is the same as the?,teacher,19,0,,,0.0
Bottom.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So they know [Inaudible] and then they count the sides.  They like to do top, bottom and then the middle.  What you’re gonna do is again choose different figures.  There’s space for five.  So can I have my distributor please?  When you get your paper what’s the first thing you do Student?",teacher,52,0,,,0.0
"Name, date and number.",student,4,0,,,
"Name, date and number please.  Why I don’t I take half, you take half, count it out.  Name, date and number.  Is everybody doing what is asked? Now one thing you can do boys and girls when you move to your group you’re gonna want to take your binder.  Where did we put the page with all of the names of the geometric solids?",teacher,64,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
We didn’t put it on [inaudible] math.  Student?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
Math vocabulary.,student,2,0,,,
"Math vocabulary.  So you’re gonna want to bring that with you so that you have the names.  And I expect them to be spelled correctly cause you’re looking right at the sheet. So I will bring the solids to you after I see everyone quietly move where they were yesterday, with the group they were with yesterday. I like how nicely Student is moving quietly, pushing her chair in.  Student just bring your chair around in front. Student.  Excellent. I love how Student’s group worked and got to their spot.  I love how Student’s group got into their formation.  I love how Student’s group got into their formation.  I like how Student’s group got into their formation.  Do you have a question?",teacher,122,0,,,0.0

What were you going to say?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
He didn’t really [inaudible] what we did yesterday with –,student,10,0,,0.0,
You know what?  I gave the directions.  I’m gonna go over them again and that way if there’s any confusion still I can clarify.  So you have your sheet.  On it you need to write the name – it says select a three dimensional figure or solid and answer the following questions about the figure. On the line what are you gonna write where it says figure number one?,teacher,69,2,0.0,,0.0

Teacher?,student,1,0,,,
Yes?  Is that a solid?  Is that a solid Student?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
So did I say you could only use some of the solids or any solids?,teacher,15,0,,,0.0
Any.,student,1,0,,,
All right.  So let’s [inaudible] the whole class?  So let’s try another.  Which one? Why isn’t this whole thing a face?  Can you tell me Student?,teacher,26,2,,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
Why isn’t this whole thing a face?,teacher,7,1,,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
And what is a face?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
[Inaudible].  Where does [that say that the face]? Underneath.  On the bottom.  [Where you find them] what is the face?  Just a flat surface?  What kind of surface?,teacher,28,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],multiple students,1,0,,,
"Rounded.  That’s why it doesn’t have a face because it’s not flat.  It’s not a face because it’s not flat.  Now why don’t you look at hemisphere?  Look at a hemisphere. What’s the one thing that a hemisphere has that a sphere doesn’t?  So it has one what?  What’s that called?  Does it have any edges?  No, because there’s no straight lines. Does it have any vertices?",teacher,67,1,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"[Inaudible] now you have [inaudible]. Now does this have any edges?  [Inaudible]  All right, eyes on me please.  Very nice.  As you’re doing this and you’re answering the questions I want to label it.  I want you to tell me you’re talking about two what?  Faces, edges, vertices.  Remember in math I spent a lot of time going over with you every time you answer a question you have to a?",teacher,71,0,,,0.0
Label.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Label.  Because sometimes you’re talking about objects, sometimes you’re talking about measurement, sometimes you’re talking about a feature of a shape so you need to distinguish by adding a label. Yes, Student.",teacher,32,1,,,0.0
Can we write an answer sentence?,student,6,0,,,
"You can just write the answer without the full sentence.  You can write an answer sentence but I want the label.  All right.  You may continue. Boys and girls I’m gonna ask you if we could break down the voices to our six inch voices.  So only the people in your own group can hear you.  I don’t want to hear you.  Okay? I’ll be right there. All right.  Boys and girls.  One more reminder.  Our voices are too loud.  It’s very hard to hear.  Okay.  So if we’re going to continue activities like this it needs to be six inch voices.  If I can hear you and I’m standing here I’m not within six inches of anyone right now.  I shouldn’t hear anybody’s voice.  I shouldn’t distinguish anyone’s voice.  [Inaudible] Boys and girls I’m gonna set the timer for three more minutes. When it goes off I want everyone to stop. Boys and girls. Thank you Student for remembering what to do when the buzzer goes off.  Pencils down, [inaudible], papers still.  Round table you need to just put your pencils on the top of your paper.  Now what I would like you to do at this moment just put this all back inside the bag and then eyes back on me. Now, very nice Student’s group.  Very nice Student’s group. Nice job Student.  So this is what we’re gonna do boys and girls, you did a great job describing the shapes by telling us what the attributes were.  What is an attribute?",teacher,254,2,1.0,,0.0
Something the shape has.,student,4,0,,,
"Something that the shape has.  Now the objective is students will be able to identify solids based on their attributes. So what we’re going to do is I’m going to call students up, you’re gonna bring your paper, you’re gonna describe the solid to the group, you’re not gonna tell them what the solid is.  Based on the attributes you’re gonna have to determine the solid.  And the way that you can let us know that you know what the solid is is by raising your?",teacher,86,2,,,0.0
Hand.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Hand.  We’re not gonna call out.  We’re not gonna make noises to get my attention to call on you.  We’re simply gonna raise our hand.  So one thing that would be helpful in this activity is if you are actually looking at the geometric solids.  So if you are actually looking at the paper. So I’m gonna use my sticks.  You can pick any solid that you did to describe.  Student.  So he’s going to come up. Students will, our objective is, you’re going to be able to identify the solid, Student, based on its attributes.",teacher,96,2,,,0.0
Can I [inaudible]?,student,3,0,,,
"Yes.  I said bring a piece of paper.  Don’t tell us the solid. Just tell us the attributes.  What the solids have.  So you could stand right at the front of the room.  I’ll wait and I would wait too, Student, I would be looking at your paper.  And I would just read off what your solid has.",teacher,58,1,,,0.0
"Zero faces, zero edges and zero vertices.",student,7,0,,,

Attributes.,multiple students,1,1,,,
"Attributes.  A cone and a hemisphere have the same attributes so we could see why Student would have said hemisphere because it does have one face, zero edges and zero vertices.  A cone also has one face, zero edges and zero vertices.  Why isn’t this a vertice?  Why is that not a vertice even though it looks like a point?  Do you know Student?  Okay.

It has to have edges because how many edges form a vertice?,teacher,12,0,1.0,,0.0
Two.,student,1,0,,,

What would have been a distinction, how could she have distinguished between the cone and the hemisphere?  What could she have said to kind of help us figure it out?  What would be the one thing that is different about them?  Student?",teacher,61,0,,,1.0

Roll.,student,1,0,,,
