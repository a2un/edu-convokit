"Okay, we’re all set.  It is on.  Okay, guys.  So we’re going to record for about the next hour.  Finished up our ten-minute math.  You can put your ten-minute math notebooks away. We’re going to take a quick look at the objective in the back.  Students add and subtract fractions by reasoning about fraction equivalents and relationships.  So as you guys know, we’ve done most of our teaching for this unit for fractions and percents.  We’re doing a lot of work now just getting ready for our assessment on Thursday. So what we’ve done is we’ve run off some open-response questions, questions that I think might have been difficult four or five weeks ago, I don’t think they’re difficult any more.  I’m going to go ahead and put up one of them and pass them out to you guys.  This first one’s pretty much a warm-up one.  I don’t want you to do the one on the other side, I just want you to do page two.  I’m going to give you guys about three or four minutes.  That’s all you need, it’s three questions.  And then we’ll go over it together. Everybody has a pencil?  No?",teacher,197,8,,,0.0

Find the fraction.,student,3,1,,,

"No, if I want to find out what one-fourth of something is, I have to know what the whole thing is, right?  I’ve got to find out the whole first.  That’s going to be the key to most every one of these.  Okay?  How can you find out the whole?",teacher,50,3,,,1.0

The books together.,student,3,0,,,
"That’s right.   And then you can go from there.  Good. Okay, you guys, anybody done?  All right, take another minute. What are you doing?  First of all, let’s get rid of this, because that’s too small of a writing tool.  Do you know how to get started on this problem?  Because I’m going to call on you, so you’d better think about what you’re doing here. Looks good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Yes?",teacher,72,0,,,0.0
Do we do this one on the back?,student,8,0,,0.0,
"No, I think we’re just going to stick with this, okay? Does it have to do with math? Is there anything you can do with that fraction? What do you think, Student A, is that done?  That’s the right answer, but is there something else you can do with it?",teacher,50,1,1.0,,1.0

"Okay.  Let’s see how we did.   Okay.  You want to stay with us when we go over this, okay?  And when we’re done going over it I’m going to come back and I want to see that you took the time to go ahead and make changes here, okay?  And be able to talk about the changes.  All right. All right, Student H, can you get one light again please?  I think just about everybody’s done here. [0:08:00] So Mia is sorting her books.  She has biographies, novels, histories, and reference books.   Student J, can you read the first one for us please?",teacher,103,0,,,0.0
What fraction of Mia’s books [inaudible].,student,6,1,,,
"Okay, so they want to know – it’s not Mel, it’s Mia – and they want to know what fraction are novels.  Walking around the room, just about everybody is all set with this.

The whole.,student,2,1,,,
"I have to know the whole, and we talked about that a lot. Okay, so it’s the whole, right, Student D? The whole of all those different types of books.  So the first thing we’re going to do, Student S, is what?  To get that hole we…",teacher,47,3,,,0.0

84.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, anybody disagree with that?",teacher,5,0,,,1.0
"Wait, was is it?",student,4,0,,,
"He said 84.  If I add 28, 13, 34 and 9, I do in fact get 84 total books.  That’s the whole.  It’s like Nana’s potatoes on the Thanksgiving table, right?  It’s the big thing. It’s all the potatoes that are available.",teacher,42,3,,,0.0

13?,student,1,0,,,
"13/84.  Okay, can I express that in lesser terms?",teacher,9,0,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
I don’t think I can.  Can somebody tell me a strategy that they have to figure out if I could or if I couldn’t?  What are some of the things you can do to see if you can put it into lesser terms.  Student D?,teacher,45,0,,,1.0
Dividing 13 to see if you would hit 84.  The times that you can multiply by is your denominator.,student,19,2,,0.0,
"Okay, so he’s saying I take multiples of 13 and see if I keep on going will I land exactly on 84.  That’s what you’re saying, right?  And if I do, then I can divide 84 by 13 and that number will be my denominator. [0:11:00] Okay, we see that a lot when we see something like this.  Okay? Sure, they’re both odd, it’s not so easy because if they were even we could just keep chopping them in half.  But here he realizes that 3 is a factor of itself obviously, but it’s also a factor of 9.  So we can divide 9 by 3 and it would end up in loose terms as 1/3.  And I think that’s a simpler way of saying what we were talking about.  All right? Does that work here?",teacher,136,4,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"It doesn’t.  Okay.  Next one.  Student A, can you read number two for us.",teacher,14,0,,,0.0
What fraction of these books are biographies?,student,7,1,,,
"Okay, so what did you get for this?",teacher,8,0,0.0,,0.0
"28/84, and I reduced it to 1/3. Okay, I actually had walked by Student A when she had done this and she had left the problem at 28/84.  Because there’s 28 biographies out of a total of 84 books.  So it’s 28/84.  And I said, can you show me that in a different way?  And then she said, “I can reduce it.” And she just said it again.  But we really don’t want to think of it in terms of reducing, guys, because if you think about something that’s being reduced, it means that you’re making it smaller, right?  But we’re not making stuff smaller, we’re dealing with this right here, equivalents.  It gives the feeling that you’re making it smaller, and you’re not making it smaller, you’re showing the same portion, you’re just showing it differently.  You’re showing it with a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator. Okay, so let’s say that we’re just going to show it in its least terms.  That’s the best way of saying it.  Yes? 7/42.",student,172,4,,0.0,
"Whoa, wait, slow down, slow down, slow down. Student D?",teacher,10,0,0.0,,0.0
It equals 14/42.,student,3,0,,,
"Okay, so I can take that 28 because it’s an even number and chop it in half.  And I can chop the 84 in half because that’s an even numbers.  So I have 14/42.  Am I done?",teacher,37,2,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"All right, Patrick, now what?",teacher,5,0,,,0.0
7 out of 21.,student,4,0,,,
"Okay, 7 out of 21.  They’re both odd numbers so I guess that’s as far as I can go, right? I can go further, Student D?",teacher,26,1,,,0.0
1/3.,student,1,0,,,
"1/3.  And the reason I can go further in 1/3 is because I know that 7 is a factor of 21, it goes into it 3 times.  7 goes into itself once, and it goes into 21, 3 times.  So it doesn’t – and we say this a lot – it doesn’t always have to be that the numerator and denominator are even numbers. There’s other ways to show fractions in lesser terms. Nice job.  Can somebody read the last one for me?  Student J?",teacher,85,4,,,0.0
What fraction of these books are not reference books?,student,9,1,,0.0,
"What fractions of the books are not reference books.  Okay. What did you do here, Student J.",teacher,17,1,1.0,,1.0
"I added biographies, novels and histories and I got 75.  And then I [inaudible].",student,14,0,,0.0,
"So you added the biographies, novels and histories and left the reference books alone.  You added those all up and you got 75.  What was that denominator again?",teacher,28,1,1.0,,0.0

"Okay.  Now I have to figure out, can I show this in lesser terms?",teacher,14,0,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No, I think this one’s pretty straightforward too.  Anybody have any questions about this?  I think this was pretty much a straightforward easy one to start with.  Turn the page over, guys, and you should have another one. I’m going to set the timer on this.  There’s only two questions on this one.  Okay, a class went to see the gorillas at the zoo.  The following sign is displayed outside the gorilla cage.  Can you identify the gorillas? And it gives you a fractural amount for Kylie, Amanda, Jerry and Homer. Hey, before you get on this question, what do you think the skill is here, guys?  What do you think we’re trying to do?",teacher,115,0,,,0.0
We’re trying to put the fractions from shortest to largest.,student,10,1,,0.0,
"Yeah, so we’re ordering fractions, okay?  It’s a lot of the work we’ve done, guys.  We’ve done a lot of equivalent work.  We’ve done a lot of ordering fraction work, and a lot of ordering fraction percent equivalents. So that’s exactly what this question is about.  You guys have about three minutes, okay?  Question?",teacher,54,6,1.0,,0.0
So we’re supposed to order it by the percents?,student,9,1,,0.0,
"Well, that is a strategy, I suppose, and then you could have to convert that, because they’re presenting you fractions, right?  So if you do go ahead and put them into percents, you’d better put them back as fractions like they have them to you.  But that’s one way of doing it, definitely. There’s another way of doing it as well besides putting them into percents, and we’ll go over both of them, okay? Yes?",teacher,75,5,1.0,,0.0
Is this supposed to be three?,student,6,0,,,
"Yes, that would be 3 out of 5. You know what you’re doing, you’re fine. Now remember, it says write the names.  You have to associate the name with the fraction and report it as a name. Good. What are you doing?  Student N, we want to try to avoid using this now, okay?  If you need to go to it for backup you can, but try it without it first, okay? You done?  If you come by here I’ll tell you something.  What’s this question asking?",teacher,87,1,1.0,,0.0
It’s asking to list the fractions from least to greatest.,student,10,1,,0.0,
"Yeah, it’s asking you to do that, but how is it asking you to report it?  As fractions?",teacher,18,1,1.0,,0.0
By the names.,student,3,0,,,
"By names.  So even though you know the math here, Student J, you absolutely know the math and I’m certain that these are all tied properly to the shortest gorilla to the tallest gorilla, but on an assessment, if they’re asking you to follow these directions and report the names, you need to write the names, or in the Rupert they might not allow me to give you credit.",teacher,69,0,,,0.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
Yes?,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
I got all the way up to here.  I got to 72 and then I noticed that if I plus it I would get to 99 and not to 100.,student,30,0,,1.0,
What are you going by?,teacher,5,0,0.0,,0.0
Six.,student,1,0,,,
"By six?   Let me turn off the thing, we’ll come right back, okay?",teacher,13,0,,,0.0
I think there might have been a difference between that one and that one.,student,14,0,,1.0,
"Let me ask you a question, why are you going by six? You put these into percents.  Can you remember how to put that into a percent?",teacher,27,2,0.0,,0.0
"It’s what I was doing, and I was going to add them all.",student,13,1,,0.0,
"Yeah, but here’s a beautiful way of doing it.  We talked a lot about this.  This is 5/6, right?  So isn’t that the same thing as 3/6 plus 2/6?  That equals 5/6.  What percent is 3/6?",teacher,36,1,1.0,,0.0
A half.,student,2,0,,,
"Yes, that’s 50 percent.  What percent is 2/6?",teacher,8,2,,,0.0
33.,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah, its 33-1/3. So if you take 50 and you add 33-1/3, you’re going to get 83-1/3 percent.  That’s like the toughest fraction to convert, but if you break it into…  It’s almost like cluster fractions, right?  We’re making familiar fractions out of something that’s maybe not so familiar and then adding them. Okay, let’s go through this one.  Student H, can you get that light again for us? Okay, as I said, there are a couple of ways we can go about this.  Walking around, just about every single person in the class decided to convert these two percents.  And I’m looking at’m, I see fifths, what else do I see there?",teacher,113,8,,,0.0
Eighths.,student,1,0,,,
"Eighths, what else?",teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Sixths. Thirds.,student,2,0,,,
"Sixths and thirds.  So we worked with all of those quite a bit. So they’re not foreign to us, they’re very manageable. The hardest one there to probably convert is the 5/6, do you guys agree?  But we’ve got a strategy for that, we can figure that one out.  In worst case scenario you pull out old page 10, right?  That’s okay, because we’re learning it still.  We’re learning it, practicing it, and getting ready for the assessment.  So we’re using all of our tools. There’s nothing wrong with that, Student N.  We’re using all of our tools to get ready. [0:23:00] All right, let’s go ahead and convert 3/5.  We’ll go to percents first.  What percent is 3/5?",teacher,119,4,,,0.0
60 percent.,student,2,1,,,
"60 percent.  And how did you figure that out, Student N? Listen up, guys, this is important stuff.  How did you know that 3/5 was 60 percent?  What was the first thing in your head that led you to get to that point?  Did you start by figuring out a fraction that was even smaller?",teacher,55,3,,,1.0
One-fifth.,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah, there you go.  Exactly.  So it’s just like if we’re trying to figure out…  For fifths it works really well. Three-fifths, we’re just going to take three groups of one- fifth.  And we all know one-fifth is how many percent?",teacher,41,1,,,0.0
20 percent.,student,2,1,,,
"20 percent.  So you just took 20 plus 20 plus 20 and you got 60 percent.  Thank you, Student N. All right, 5/8.  It’s a little more tricky.  Sure, I could find out what 1/8 is.  What’s 1/8?",teacher,38,2,,,0.0
12-1/2 percent.,student,2,1,,,
12-1/2 percent.  And I could just take how many groups of that?,teacher,12,1,,,0.0
"Four, oh five.",student,3,0,,,
"Five.  That’s not very efficient, it’ll work.  Another way of doing it is to just do what?",teacher,17,0,,,0.0
"Five-eighths is close to four-eighths, which is half.  You add 12-1/2 percent on 50 percent.",student,15,3,,1.0,
"Nice.  Okay, so this would have been 50 percent, and 12-1/2 percent.  You added those together and you got…",teacher,19,2,1.0,,0.0
62.,student,1,0,,,
"Right.  I think for 5/6 that strategy works the best.  Okay, we know that 5/6 is 3/6 plus 2/6.  And all of us know that 3/6 is how many percent?",teacher,30,1,,,0.0
50.,student,1,0,,,
"50 percent, it’s one half, but we’re talking in percents so we’re going to keep our labeling straight. [0:25:00] And we know that 2/6, I can show that in lesser terms as what?",teacher,33,2,,,0.0
One-third.,student,1,0,,,
"Very nice, one-third.  And we all know…  And that was one of the things we said at the beginning of the unit.  Some things you just have to commit to memory, okay?  And one- third is one of those things.  You just have to know that one-third is…",teacher,48,1,,,0.0
33.,student,1,0,,,
"And one third.    33-1/3.   If you say 33-1/2, you’re going to mess up the whole problem.  It’s not 33-1/2, it’s 33-1/3. We went through a bunch of ways to determine that.  That’s just something you guys just have to commit to knowing, okay?  So maybe you can figure out a sixth, and you can figure out two-sixths, you can figure out four-sixths.  It helps you with your thirds and your sixths.  That’s the starting point right there with one-third. All right, next one.  So this was 50 percent and 33-1/3.  That was 80…",teacher,93,2,,,0.0
"…3 and a third. And a third.  And Homer is two-thirds as tall as the tree.  We all know that two-thirds is what, Student H? Two-thirds is 66 percent.",student,29,1,,0.0,
"Thank you.  Okay, so we’re going to write the names of the gorillas in order from shortest to tallest, from least to greatest.  Looking around the room too, I talked to Student J about this, saw it with a couple of other students.  A lot of students in this room were doing this problem, which everybody understood the math, they just wrote the fractions down.  And they’re not asking for the fractions, guys.  You have to give them what they want, not what you think they want.  So a lot of students in this classroom… Some students might even have just written down the percents.  That’s wrong.  The math’s correct but you didn't give them what they asked for.  Now in MCAST, guys, you’ve gotta read the directions.  This is directions right here. And the directions clearly say, write the names.  If you don’t follow the directions you’re not going to get the right answer. Maybe you’ll get an answer that looks right, but it might not be exactly what they’re looking for, what they asked for.  So now we’re going to go by names.  Who is the shortest, which name?",teacher,191,3,0.0,,0.0

He’s the shortest one.,student,4,0,,,
"Okay, is he shorter than all…  Yeah, he is definitely, because the next tallest one is Kylie, who is 60 percent of the tree.",teacher,24,1,,,0.0
So he’s the shortest.,student,4,0,,,
"Yeah, he would be the shortest one.  Okay. I want to look at this another way too, guys.  Sometimes our denominators are not really easy for us to see, like eighths and sixths and halves and fifths and thirds. Sometimes … you know, we didn't really do much work in twelfths. Twelfths can be used as a fraction, as a denominator, definitely.  We didn't do much work in …",teacher,69,3,,,0.0
Sevenths.,student,1,0,,,
"We didn't really do any work in sevenths at all, you’re right. Anybody have another strategy for solving this?  It’s worth putting a little time in here, guys.  If I didn't want to do percents, how else could I identify from least to greatest?  Anybody?",teacher,45,1,,,1.0
Add the fractions.,student,3,2,,,
"That’s right.  Keep it as fractions.  And in order to keep it as fractions, I’ve got to do something with the denominators.  What do I have to do with the denominators?",teacher,31,4,,,0.0
Get a common denominator.,student,4,1,,,
"I’ve got to get them all common, I’ve got to make them the same.  So basically what I’ve got to do is I’ve got thirds, I’ve got fifths, I’ve got eighths, I’ve got sixths, and I’ve got thirds. Now I’m going to look for the largest number here, which is what?",teacher,51,0,,,0.0
Eighths.,student,1,0,,,
"Eighths.  And I’m going to count by eighths.  I’m going to do multiples of eight, starting with eight, until I find a number that has three, six, eight and five as factors of it.  That’s the way to do it.  That’s like the big shot math talk way of doing it, but that’s it, that’s how we’re going to find the common denominator.  Start with the largest one.  So we’re going to start with eight.  So eight goes into itself, we’re good there.  Five doesn’t.  Six doesn’t.  And three doesn’t.  I’ve got to go to the next one, 16.  I know that 5 doesn’t go into 16.  I know that 5 is only going to be a factor of numbers that end in 5 and 0.  So maybe I’ll just go to those right now.  Will 20 work?  Well, it doesn’t work for 8.  So let’s stick with 8. What’s the first multiple of 8 that ends in a 0 or a 5.",teacher,163,4,,,0.0

No.,student,1,0,,,
"No, it’s not going to work.  Does it work for 6?  Well, it doesn’t matter, since it doesn’t work for 3, we can just stop.  The next one would be 120.  And 120 would work.  We can drop off that zero off the end, right?  Yeah, it would work.  Now that’s going to be a whole lot of work, all right, but it could be done.  We could set this up as one- hundred-and-twentieths and we could just go through it, okay, and find out.  Okay, 5 times what equals 120? [0:31:00]",teacher,92,2,,,0.0
14?,student,1,0,,,
"5 x 20 is 100.  So it’s 24.  And then we would have to take 24 x 3 and that would be our numerator.  So it’s a lot of work, but it can be done.  I think in this question at the fifth grade level, guys, I think they’re just going to give you problems, if they ask you to order fractions like this with denominators that are going to be really tough to find a common one for, I think they’re probably going to allow you guys just to work with percents, okay?  And there’s been a lot of this unit work with percents and fractions, so I think that’s probably a safe bet, and you guys all seem pretty steady with it. All right, let’s go to the next one.

Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah, it makes sense, right?  There’s equivalents.  Sometimes it’s harder to find them but it can be done.  Now this time they’re not asking you for fractions, they’re asking you for percents, right?  So what percent of this total for the week did Malik catch on Mondays?  So on Monday he caught 12, right?

So this is really basic number sense here, Student P, which you know, which you just have to be careful as you’re going through it, okay?

So Malik went fishing every day after school for a week and kept track of the number of fish he caught each day.  He put that data in a table. So it looks like on Monday through Friday he fished, the first day he caught 12, he caught 6 and 8, on Thursday he caught 16, and finally on Friday he caught 6.

Not a bad idea to underline what they’re looking for, okay?  We don’t use a lot of highlighters for that, some classrooms do, but while you’re reading the problem and they’re talking about percents, maybe circle that in the problem so that your mind and your head will see back and you’ll look at and then you just won’t forget and report it as a fraction.  Because if you report this as one-fourth, I have to mark it wrong.  And that’s a shame, because you know the math.  If you got to one-fourth, you know the math.  So please follow all the directions, okay?  In other words, do not speed through your assessment.  This has been a seven-week unit, the longest unit of the year, typically the most difficult assessment of the year.  So everybody has to slow down and take care of their business on this.  Okay, Student D?  You like to do these tests fast, and sometimes it costs you a point or two, you know, and that’s all the difference in the world All right, let’s go to the next one.

"Okay.  Now if I take that 50 and that I get 62-1/2.  Now here’s the key to the problem, right?  I get 60, 66-2/3, 62 and 25.  Because this is a two-quart bowl, 100 percent equals one quart.  So this is 200 percent, or 200.  If I add this number, this number, this number and this number, if they come up to be less than 200 percent, which is 200, if it comes up less, then I know I can fit it in that bowl.

I’m just going to add – I’m going to take that 60, I’m going to take 60 of that 66, I’m going to take 60 of that 62 and I’m going to take 20 of that 25.  He knows, and this is what I was getting at, he knows that there’s a little more.  In this case it’s 6-2/3, this is 2-1/2, and this is 5 percent more.  But he added those up and got 200 percent.  So that will fit in the bowl.  But any number more than 200 won’t fit in this 2-quart bowl, which is 200 percent.  So I agree with you, Student S, it won’t work.  Did anybody add these numbers up and come up with the exact number?  What did you do here, Student J?",teacher,160,7,0.0,,0.0
"I added 60 percent, and 66, I left the fraction, I added the fraction last, because I thought it was harder.  So I added 60 percent, and 6 66 percent, 62 percent, and 25 percent, and got 213 percent.",student,39,8,,0.0,
"And you just could stop here, couldn't you?  You didn't have to go any further, did you?  Because when you did that, you got 200 and what?",teacher,27,0,1.0,,0.0

"213 percent.  Since you were over 200 percent you knew right off the bat that it wouldn't fit in there.  So you didn't even have to go back and do that extra fraction work.  But did you?  Yeah, and what did you get?",teacher,43,3,,,0.0
I got 213-7/6.,student,3,0,,,
"And 7/6?  So you ended up with 213 and 7/6?  Something looking like an improper fraction there.  Help me out, can I change that into another number?",teacher,27,1,,,0.0
1 and 1/6.,student,3,0,,,
"Right.  So I take the 1 out of the 1-1/6 and add it to the 213, I get 214.  So 214-1/6 is definitely more than 200.  So, no, the fruit salad will not fit into that 2-quart bowl. Would it fit in a 3-quart bowl?  Student H?",teacher,47,3,,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
It would?  Why would it fit in a 3-quart bowl?,teacher,10,1,,,1.0
"Because it’s less than 300 percent.  A three quart bowl is 300 percent, and that’s less than 300 percent.",student,19,4,,1.0,
Okay.  Yes?,teacher,2,0,0.0,,0.0
I went and found the common denominator and did all that.,student,11,1,,0.0,
What did you come up with for a common denominator?,teacher,10,1,1.0,,0.0
120.,student,1,0,,,
"Yes.  Student J and I talked about that too.   So there’s going to be some number out there that would work as a common denominator, and then you just added those up and showed them in lesser terms and brought it back down and it came out to a little more than two, right?",teacher,54,1,,,0.0
The numerator was 257.,student,4,1,,,
257.  And the denominator was what?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
240.,student,1,0,,,
120.  Right?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
"No, because it was a 2-quart bowl.",student,7,1,,,
"Right, oooh, good question.  No, it still says the same. Because look what would happen, Student D.  120 goes into 257 two times, right?  This is one quart, think of it that way, okay?  But now you have two, and what would be left over is 37.  So this is the 2 quarts and this is the extra is 37.  If you did your numbers right.  Student J and I decided we can do that, but it’s a lot of work finding a denominator that big, and then think of all the math steps you have to go through to show it in lesser terms. There’s so many more steps, so much more chance of making a mathematical error even though you know the math.  You could do it.  It’s a legitimate strategy.  It’s complex and it takes a little more time, but it will work. Okay, are we good, guys?",teacher,151,3,1.0,,0.0

"All right, we still have some work to do with this.  What we’re going to do is, we’re going to do in between for the next 15 minutes till we switch.  So but these in your math folders, break into your partners that are sitting at the tables with you.  Student D, I want you to work with the people that are right across from you.  Student D and Student A, I want you to go to the round table in the back and have Student N be your partner.  Everybody get their decks of cards, okay?  In between, if you need a set of copies on the rules, they’re up here on the table. I think everybody’s good with it though.",teacher,122,0,,,0.0
Can I go to the back table?,student,7,0,,,
"No, stay up here, okay, just the group of three back there.",teacher,12,0,1.0,,0.0

"We can do that in between, that’s fine.   Once you get your deck of fraction cards, guys, you can go ahead and get your snacks too.  And then if everybody wants to turn to the camera and say thank you?   Thank you!",teacher,42,1,,,0.0
