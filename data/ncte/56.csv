So yesterday we started a conversation about this question right here.  Can someone read the question please?  Student C.,teacher,19,0,,,0.0
Miss [inaudible] owned a [native bookstore].  She had 56 apples to arrange in rows for her [inaudible] window display.  She has room for four rows in her window.  How many apples will be in each row if she puts the same number in each row?,student,45,0,,0.0,
"And we also talked about the important pieces of information. So what are the important pieces of information from this problem, Student A?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,1.0
56 apples to arrange in four rows.,student,7,0,,,
"So 56 apples, and they needed to be arranged in four rows, and then what is the question that we needed to stay focused on?  Student F.",teacher,27,0,1.0,,0.0
How many apples will be in each row if she puts the same number in each [inaudible].,student,17,0,,0.0,
"So we underlined that information yesterday.  56 apples, four rows that they needed to be arranged in, and then how many apples will be in each row.  And we have to keep in mind that the same number had to be in each row.  How did we approach this problem yesterday?  What were you thinking about?  You had the option to use cubes, the tiles, and grid paper.  So what were you thinking about yesterday, Student A?",teacher,77,2,1.0,,1.0
We do our making [rows].,student,5,0,,,
Could you say that a little bit louder?,teacher,8,0,0.0,,0.0
We were making rows to find – we were making four rows and then if they to ought to have the same tiles in each then that’s the answer.,student,29,0,,0.0,
"So four groups with the same number of tiles in each group, and then if they were all the same that was the answer, and so you used tiles.  Any other thoughts, Student V?",teacher,34,0,1.0,,1.0
I used [inaudible].,student,3,0,,,
A little bit louder.,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
I just did it [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
And how did you do it?  If you need to grab your notebook feel free.,teacher,15,0,1.0,,1.0
I did half of each [inaudible] and half [inaudible].,student,9,0,,0.0,
Just talk a little bit louder.,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
"I did half of 56 equals 28, and then I did half of 28 equals 14, and that [inaudible]. Teacher:   Can you explain why that worked? You had 28 [inaudible].",student,30,0,,0.0,
A little bit louder.  I can’t even hear you.,teacher,9,0,0.0,,0.0
"Half of 56 is 28, and then the other half is 28, and half of 28 is 14 and you get two [inaudible] out of 28.  You get two 14s out of 28 equals the other two [inaudible].",student,38,0,,0.0,
But why are you cutting 56 in half and then cutting 28 in half?,teacher,14,0,1.0,,1.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
So you're doing this to get four groups.  So when you took the half of the 56 and you got 28 how many groups did you have?,teacher,27,0,,,1.0
I can’t [inaudible].  Two 28s.,student,5,0,,,
"So here you had two groups of 28, and then you took those two groups –",teacher,16,0,0.0,,0.0
Split them in half.,student,4,0,,,
"Split them in half again, and so then you ended up with how many groups?",teacher,15,0,,,0.0
Four.,student,1,0,,,
Four groups.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Of 14.,student,2,0,,,
"Of 14.  Can somebody else explain what she’s talking about, or at least get us started on another way to explain this idea?  Student R.",teacher,25,0,,,1.0
I used cubes to find out the equation of 56 divided by 4.,student,13,3,,0.0,
"Can you help talk about this idea first?  Why do you think Student V was cutting 56 in half and then again in half? So she got an answer of 28, and then she took that 28 and cut that in half again.  Student R give it a try.",teacher,49,0,1.0,,1.0
"It’s like if you wanted to split it down [56] you'll get 28, and then [inaudible] to get your [inaudible] answer you just [inaudible] on the 28, 14, and [inaudible].",student,30,0,,1.0,
And so that’s a start.  I’m gonna call on someone else. Student R what are you thinking?,teacher,17,0,0.0,,1.0
She just cut it in half the 56 into [inaudible] the 28 to get 14.,student,15,0,,0.0,
Why?,teacher,1,0,0.0,,1.0
Because if you divide 28 then you try and [to make] four groups.,student,13,1,,1.0,
Keep thinking.  Student A.,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
She cut [inaudible] I mean she [inaudible] but two 28s and four rows.  She has to cut it down so there can be four.,student,24,0,,0.0,
Student B.,teacher,2,0,0.0,,0.0
"I think she [could] that because 28 plus 28 equals 56, and then 14 is half of 28 because if you cut it in half 14 take off half of the 28.",student,32,0,,1.0,
Student V did you draw any picture in your notebook?,teacher,10,0,0.0,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Can you come up and draw it on the overhead what you drew? Student R wants to add to that while she’s working on her picture?,teacher,26,1,,,0.0
"Yeah, I just wanted to see something.  Four is a factor of [inaudible].  Four is a factor of 28, and four is a factor of 14, and –",student,28,0,,0.0,
"If we count by fours will we land on 14?  No, we don’t.  So maybe factor isn’t the right idea but maybe what you're thinking about.",teacher,26,0,1.0,,0.0
"Just think if you take the 14 and then you take the [inaudible] it’s almost the [inaudible] [length] as the [inaudible], like 4 times 2 equals 8.",student,27,1,,1.0,
You mean the 8 from the 28?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"I think I want to concentrate more on why she’s breaking these numbers in half.  [Long pause] So is that what your picture looked like?  Can I actually – 56.  I actually want to draw the first idea that you said.  So he has 56.  That’s what I feel like I heard when you said that you cut the 56 in half, and you show it in this picture, but it’s really that picture really shows the 14s.",teacher,78,0,,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
It equals that 28 each time for the two groups.,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
[That’s right].,student,2,0,,,
"Yes.  So here’s the 56, and she said so first she cut it in half, and she gets 28.  How many groups does she have when it’s cut in half and there’s 28 in each group?  How many groups is that?  Student K right here.  How many groups does she have?",teacher,51,0,,,0.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"She has two groups.  So if we transfer that idea to the question, we’re talking about rows, does Mrs. [Sanchez] only want two rows?",teacher,24,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
How many rows does Mrs. S want?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0
Four.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So I’m guessing that Student V is now thinking, “Okay, well I can get a four out of there.  All I need to do is cut those groups in half again.”  And luckily these numbers work pretty nicely when we’re cutting them in half.  So there’s no leftovers.  There’s no number that we have to share.  So when she cut it in half now in each group there are 14.  Do you see the picture that matches what she’s talking about, cutting these ideas, cutting these numbers in half?",teacher,89,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So she first cut the 56 in half, and the 56 gets cut in half, and it was 28 and 28.  Then she took it and she cut it again in half, and it got to be 14 for the four groups.  So she knew her final answer had to be 14 because that means there would be 14 in each row.  Student L, are you with me? Up.  Now a lot of you built this with tiles. A lot of you built this with tiles, and you just had an array, and you had four rows with 14 in each, and I’m not going to do the entire thing, but this is how you got started, right?",teacher,118,1,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"If you use the tiles or you use the cubes how did you know how to start arranging them on your desk?  How did you know how to start arranging them on your desk, Student R?",teacher,36,1,,,1.0
You could put 56 and [inaudible] five tens and then six ones and then [inaudible] the fact that 56 was 28 and half of 28 was 14.  You could put the 14 in four rows.,student,35,0,,0.0,
So say that again.,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
"You have about ten groups of five, and then a group of six ones, and then if you know half of 56 is 28 and half of 28 is 14 you can put the 14 into two rows [inaudible].",student,39,0,,1.0,
"So you're actually building up on that idea here?  You're just using the tiles.  Anybody else have an explanation as to how you arranged your tiles, how you knew to do the four rows on your desk, Student S?",teacher,39,0,1.0,,1.0
"Miss R, I noticed something.",student,5,0,,,
What did you notice?,teacher,4,0,1.0,,1.0
That four’s a factor of 28.  I mean four is a factor of 28 and [inaudible] is a factor of 14.  So if you [inaudible] 28 to [inaudible] 14 it gives you the answer.,student,34,0,,0.0,
It is four a factor of 14?  If we count by fours do we get to 14?,teacher,17,0,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No.  We talked about that with Student R a few minutes ago, but four is part of that 28, and that’s one of the reasons why we’re able to [inaudible] this up here and then [inaudible].  So any other thoughts as to how you arranged your tiles on your desk, Student K?",teacher,52,0,,,1.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
Student C [laughter].,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
I kept the [inaudible] in [inaudible].,student,6,0,,,
So you took out all 56?,teacher,6,0,0.0,,1.0
And [inaudible] was [inaudible] groups [inaudible].  I got my answer.,student,10,0,,0.0,
"When you had the 56 did you put them into four groups one at a time – one, one, one, one?",teacher,21,0,1.0,,0.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
How did you start organizing that?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0
One group of 14 and then a group of [inaudible].,student,10,0,,0.0,
"So when you were passing out the tiles did you say one tile to the first row, another tile to the second row, one more tile to the third row, to the fourth row?  Student A.",teacher,36,0,0.0,,0.0
We could break them down to two groups.  You could start off at 12 and then each row could put 12 and then if that doesn't work just add on.,student,30,1,,0.0,
So you started off by putting 12 in each row?,teacher,10,0,1.0,,1.0
"Yes, [inaudible].",student,2,0,,,
"And so that actually would be 12 times 4, right?  And then you added on by ones from there.  So that’s a little bit different than just passing out one at a time, and that’s actually something that I want you to focus on today. Whether you're using manipulatives, or you're drawing a picture, or you're just writing down equations I want you to try to think about these ideas by passing them out in groups. So instead of passing out one to each group at a time think about how you can pass out a larger amount.  So Student A is saying that he could have given 12 to each row.  So that would be the four groups of 12, and then we have all the extras that get us up to 56 that we can pass out by ones, or maybe if you have enough and you can tell that you have enough you can pass them out by two.  Student F.",teacher,164,1,,,0.0
"I put all the [inaudible] pieces and then I put them in rows. I put 11 in each row, and then I had [12 more] left, and then I put [inaudible] other ones [inaudible] and got 13.",student,37,0,,0.0,
"So that’s even another idea.  So instead of doing the 12 in each row you could also do 11 in each row, which would be your 11 times 4 and then add on the additional ones from there.  So same idea as Student A, but just a different amount that you're doing, a bigger chunk.  This reminds me of when you're doing the bigger array small array.  You're trying to make smaller arrays that can help you solve the larger problem. So you need to keep all of these things in mind today when you're working on this.  How are you going to figure out what the final answer is?  How are you going to represent that answer, and how are you going to figure out what the final answer is?  Are you doing it with larger groups?  Are you passing things out by ones? Are you just looking at the tiles?  Are you just looking at your cubes?  Do understand what I’m saying?",teacher,164,6,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"My last question before we get started with today’s activity, some of you yesterday started doing this, 56 times 4 equals blank.  A couple of you caught yourself and said, “Oh, that wasn’t what the problem was asking.”  A couple of you I asked you a few questions and then you were able to say, “No, that’s not what we’re doing.” Why isn’t this problem 56 times 4?  Again, here’s the problem.  We have Mrs. S who owns a neighborhood store.  She has 56 apples to arrange in rows, and she wants four rows.  How come the problem does not work for 56 times 4?  Student H, if you need to move your seat please do so.  How come 56 times 4 is not what we wanted to do, Student D?",teacher,131,0,,,0.0
Because you're trying to 56 [inaudible] in four rows.,student,9,0,,1.0,
You're trying to get to 56 in four rows.  Student V?,teacher,11,0,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"It’s going to equal a much bigger number, and those of you that I spoke to yesterday you had a very large number and my first question to you, “Is it possible to have that many in each row if all you have is 56?”  You had a number in the 200s didn’t you?",teacher,54,0,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
And so if we have a number in the 200s is that going to work if all together we only have 56 apples?,teacher,23,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So think about these ideas.  Is your answer reasonable?  Yes?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
You can’t use time tables.  You can’t use a time table so that became division,student,15,1,,0.0,
So how do we write [that’s] division?,teacher,7,1,1.0,,0.0
56 divided by 4 equals 14.,student,6,1,,,
"So it’s not this, but we can write 56 divided by 4 equals our answer of 14.  So we’re moving into divisions problems. You can take a seat right next to Student R if that works, or you can take a seat right next to Student S.  Yes?",teacher,48,2,1.0,,0.0
"I did it solving [inaudible] different way.  I knew 28 plus 28 equals 56, and 14 plus 14 equals 28.  So I did 14 plus 14 equals 28.  You take away, get rid of the 14, and [inaudible].",student,38,0,,0.0,
So maybe that was a similar thinking that we had here with Student V?  Yes?,teacher,15,0,0.0,,1.0
Can you take a number line?,student,6,1,,,
How would you do it with a number line?,teacher,9,1,1.0,,1.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"So maybe try it today, and see if what the problems today if it would work on the number line, and maybe jumping in a certain number of groups.  Because last year in third grade you did multiplication with jumping on a number line.  So maybe that idea will help you here too.  So what I need you to do is take out your math books.  You need to grab pages 16 and 17.  Tear them out.  Unit three.",teacher,79,4,,,0.0
Unit three?,student,2,1,,,
"Yes.  16 and 17.  [Long Pause].  As soon as you get those pages out you can get started.  You have the choice of using equations, pictures, manipulative – they’re on the counter – graph a grid paper, your choice.  And as long as things [inaudible] moving like yesterday you're all set. [Crosstalk].   Yes.  Yes. [Crosstalk] Okay, it looks like most of you are ready to start.  Remember to think about how can you do this in bigger groups instead of just passing out one at a time. Boys and girls when you're figuring out the problem it would be helpful if you have a multiplication or a division sentence written.  Some of you have done that already, but if you haven't please try to do that. We’re gonna work for about five, ten more minutes. In three more minutes we’re going to stop. One more minute. All right, I want everybody to get to a stopping point please, and I want you to turn your attention back to number one, even though the majority of you have finished that one quite a bit ago.  Student L, Student L?",teacher,188,4,,,0.0

We’ll take care of that afterwards.  Just take your seat.  Can somebody read problem number one out loud?  Student A.,teacher,20,0,,,0.0
48 fourth graders at the Glendale School are taking a field trip to the science museum.  They need to put into their group of three students for a special science project at the museum.  How many groups will there be?,student,40,0,,0.0,

Three groups.  Student V?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0

Before we get to any equation I want to know the important pieces of information.  So three groups is an important piece.  So that three is important.  Student C?,teacher,29,1,,,0.0
There are 48 fourth-graders.,student,4,0,,,
"So there are 48 students, and is it telling you that there are three groups or three students in each group?",teacher,21,0,,,1.0
Three groups. Three students in each group.,multiple students,7,0,,,
"So I’m hearing both.  So I wonder if it matters when it comes down to solving the problem.  Is it okay if we have three groups?  Is it okay if we have three students in each group?  So I’m actually going to put both here.  What is the equation that we will use to solve this problem, without the answer?  So equals blank.  Student S?",teacher,65,1,1.0,,0.0
48 divided by three.,student,4,1,,,
Do we agree on that?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Student R?  Student L go switch so we don’t have please.  Do we agree it’s 48 divided by three equals blank?,teacher,21,1,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So can someone get us started?  How do we solve this problem? I need Student L, Student A, and Student A I need eyes up here.  How do we start this problem?  Student [K]?  Can I have hands off cubes and tiles so that we can hear what everyone’s saying?",teacher,50,1,,,0.0
[inaudible] times three equals [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
That’s an excellent start.  Can someone tell me why this is a good start?  What does three times ten equal thirty tell us?  Why is it a good start?  Student A?,teacher,31,0,0.0,,1.0
[inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, Student R.",teacher,3,0,,,0.0
It’s a good start because the three from the 48 divided by three.  You put it in [inaudible] times ten and you end up where the ten is you'll get your answer.,student,32,1,,1.0,
What do you mean where the ten is we’re gonna get our answer?,teacher,13,0,1.0,,1.0
If you keep adding them up to 48 then [inaudible] your answer.,student,12,0,,0.0,
Where are we going to have the 48?  Is the 48 going to be where the 30 is or is it going to be here?,teacher,25,0,1.0,,0.0
Where the 30 is.,student,4,0,,,
So I think what Student R means by the answer is that our final answer is gonna to be here somewhere.  So can someone add onto what Student K started with us?  She started by doing three times ten equals 30.  I’m not seeing that many hands. So my question is what does this three stand for?,teacher,57,1,,,0.0

"Well it’s a multiple of ten, yeah.  So it came from three times ten.  What does 30 represent Student B?",teacher,20,1,,,1.0
The students.,student,2,0,,,
"It represents the students.  So this first equation that Student K gave us is telling us 30 students so far.  So here’s our three students in each group.  The ten is the number of groups.  So there are those students in that number of groups, and we have 30 students taken care of. Are we done with the problem?",teacher,59,1,,,0.0

We know that there needs to be three students in a group.  How are we going to get to the 18?  Think about your facts.  How are we going to get to 18? We know that there are 18 students we still have left.  We know that there has to be three students in a group.  So how are we going to get to 18?  How many threes are going to get us to 18?

48.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Is that the answer to our problem?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0
Yes. No.,multiple students,2,0,,,
So your question again is how many groups will there be?  Are there going to be 48 groups?  Yes or no?,teacher,21,0,,,1.0
Yes. No.,multiple students,2,0,,,
What’s the 48 representing?  Student V relax [laughter].  What does the 48 represent?  Student A what does the 48 represent in our problem?,teacher,23,0,,,0.0

This is the students.  So there are a total of 48 students. Where’s our answer?  How many groups are we gonna need? Student K eyes up here.  Student F?,teacher,29,1,,,0.0
The 30 and the 18.,student,5,0,,,
So that was our 48 students.  Is that our answer?,teacher,10,0,0.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
So our problem is 48 divided by 3 equals blank.  The 48 are the 48 students.  Student K did a nice job starting us off with a three by ten.  That was 30 students.  Then we had 3 times 6 to get us 18 more students.  Student R can you tell us where the answer is?,teacher,56,1,,,0.0

"Yes.  Three students in each group, and Student V I like that you said that three didn't change.  So yeah, that’s representing the students in the groups.  So what is the final answer?  It’s in the middle.  What is the final answer?  How many groups are we going to need, Student L?",teacher,52,0,,,0.0
16 groups.,student,2,0,,,

"It is 16.  So the number of groups we need is 16.  So our big array would have been a three by sixteen, right?",teacher,24,1,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So there would have been three cubes in every single group because there were three kids in each group, but Student K made a nice big jump.  She said, “Let’s start off with a three by ten, and then that leaves us with just a three by six.”  So even though we’re moving into division that big array small array idea is coming back and it’s gonna help you solve these division problems. So we can write this as 48 divided by 3 is equal to 16 groups of students.  We can also say that 3 times 16 is equal to what?",teacher,102,6,,,1.0

"And that’s not the only way that it could have broken down. Student D I just heard you say that yours was different. This is not the only way to do it.  I like that we started with the three times ten because you all know your tens. You know your time tables of tens.  Those are facts that you can say pretty fast, and a few of you when I met with you we talked about that, and I think it was for numbers three. Student C I think that’s when I was talking to you about when you broke it down into a multiple of ten first, and actually you too, for number three, you also broke it down into the tens.  So that’s a fact to go to so you don’t have to be counting by threes every single time.  You could have – can I break this up?  You could have taken three cubes and just have kept going until you got to your 48, but I want you to start taking larger jumps. Last year, third grade, you counted by threes until you got to whatever you needed to.  This year you don’t need to.  You can move beyond that, taking a huge jump.  You know 3 times 10 is 30.  So that’s ten of these right away that you don’t need to have in front of you.  Any questions you have about number one?  Student S any questions?",teacher,244,2,1.0,,0.0

"Well, you could have the [inaudible] of ten and then add the eight.",student,13,1,,0.0,
"So if we’re thinking about addition, if you're thinking about adding tens and then an eight you have to connect that back to the problem.  Is that going to help us get three groups or three students in our group if we’re adding tens?  So 'cause one group would be three students, another group would be three. So just think about that.  Go back to the problem and see if it makes sense with the problem.  Are we okay with this?",teacher,81,1,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So this idea is going to connect to what we’re doing tomorrow. I know you all did not finish all four problems and that’s fine. Tomorrow we’re gonna continue, and we’re gonna talk about what happens when we have leftovers.  So we’re solving a problem like this, but then we have some leftovers.  Not tomorrow, Monday, I’m sorry.  What’s gonna happen when we do have leftovers.  We need to clean up, get all of our cubes and everything back into place.",teacher,81,1,,,0.0
