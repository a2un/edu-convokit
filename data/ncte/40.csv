Three more what?,teacher,3,0,1.0,,0.0
Three more numbers.,student,3,0,,,
"Do you all understand what Student S is trying to say, three more numbers?  What does she mean?",teacher,18,0,,,1.0

No.,student,1,0,,,
Or just with this equation.,teacher,5,1,,,0.0
It always works.,student,3,0,,,
"It always works?  And some people aren’t sure?  Not sure? Okay.  Let’s try another one.  How about 15 times 8.  Can you solve this one?  Student R, can you solve this one?  15 times 8?  Student R, you might want to sit over there if you can’t see well, all right?  Student J?",teacher,53,0,,,0.0

"He halved it.  Student G, which factor did you half?",teacher,10,0,1.0,,1.0

I agree.,student,2,0,,,
"Agree, 60, okay.  So this time we halved it.  But we were talking about doubling it, can we try that also?  Let’s try and double it.  So we started with this.  First of all, out of these factors, which would be the best one to try doubling.  Student Z?",teacher,49,1,,,0.0
15?,student,1,0,,,
How come?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Because 15 is an easier number.  Because 15 plus 15 is 30.  And sometimes 8 plus 8 [inaudible].,student,18,0,,1.0,
"Okay.  Boys and girls, do you agree with that?  Would you rather be multiplying by 30 or by 16?",teacher,19,1,1.0,,1.0
30.,student,1,0,,,
30.  And what do we call those numbers?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
Landmarks.,student,1,0,,,
"30 is more of a landmark, right?  So we’re going to double the 15.  So we doubled this factor, and what we’re testing is what happens to the product.  What do you think, Student C?",teacher,35,1,,,1.0

We have to multiply by doubling?,student,6,1,,,
"Well, we were halving here.  This one stayed the same, 15 times 8.  And here we kept the 15, this factor, but we said 15 times 4.  So it’s halved.  So do you see?  This one got in half, it went from 8 to 4.  Do you see that Student B?  So what happened to the product?",teacher,57,1,0.0,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
So what was the product on the first one?,teacher,9,1,,,0.0
15 times 8.,student,3,0,,,

It splits.,student,2,0,,,
It splits.  So the product’s split?,teacher,6,1,,,1.0
The product on that one is split into half.,student,9,1,,0.0,

I doubled it.  And what did I do to my second factor?,teacher,12,0,1.0,,0.0

What’s this side going to be?",teacher,63,2,0.0,,0.0
"15.  No, 8.",student,3,0,,,

Okay, boys and girls in your workbooks, we’re going to be working on pages 61 and 62.  Unit 3 still.   And I want you to pay attention to the strategies that you’re using to answer the multiplication questions.  61 and 62, right here.  I don’t want to have to say this, Unit 3.

Or it looked like you were trying to do 36 x 4 and then double it, because you’re halving this factor, so the answer will be half.  Do you want to work on these for a few minutes and I’ll check back in, okay? So Student K, I see you started with this.  So it looks like this factor is the same, and where did you get this factor? Student S?  I don’t want to see that any more.  And what’s the answer.",teacher,122,0,,,0.0
