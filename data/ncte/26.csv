"Yeah.  B is actually the 10th multiple.  So if we took B and doubled it – 260 plus 260 gives us 520, because the 10th plus the 10th gives us the 20th.  Okay?  I’d like you to do these, or start this on your own, please.  I’m coming around.  If you would like to work with someone next to you – no one’s leaving their seats – but if you want to work with someone next to you, you can.

What about 43 divided by 6?  So rewrite that in another way.  So you’re telling me 43 divided by 6 is 9.  What you’re saying is 6 times 9 equals 43.  Is that true?",teacher,74,3,,,0.0

"Okay, well, actually, in the process you’ve kind of gotten us close to this, though.  So 6 times 7 equals 42.  Are we going to be able to hit 43?  No, because we’re going to end up going over, right?  So we have to add more groups.  So 6 times 7 equals 42.  So 43 divided by 6 is going to give us what?  How many 6s can fit into 43?  How many can you fit into 42?  How many 6s fit into 42?",teacher,84,2,,,0.0
