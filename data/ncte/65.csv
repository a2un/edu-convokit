What do you think Student A?",teacher,52,1,,,1.0
I think that the taxes are already included.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"Yeah.  It says, ""Prices include tax.""  So that means if there is six cents that has to be added on, that six cents is already in those prices.  We don't have to take any extra money and tack it on to those prices.  The tax is already in there, okay?  That's why it says prices include the tax. I'm going to pull down the screen.  I love the attention I am seeing so far.  Lots of focus.  Good job.  All right. Let's see.  I'm going to move this up.",teacher,89,0,1.0,,0.0

You might not want to draw the lines just yet, but when you go to solve you're going to need three sections.  I'm going to lift up the screen.  I'm going to erase the underlinings and circlings on the board so everyone will be able to see the chart.  I'm going to put the screen up.  So what you're going to do is you're going to work with your group on solving the problems.  Go through the steps.  When you are done with question A, and you get down to seven, you need to make sure seven and eight, you go back up to A again.
