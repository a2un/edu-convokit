"You can do length times width?  So can you show me on one of your – Number 9 maybe?  Do you have a Number 9?  How about Number 10?  Or Number 9.  That’s fine. So, you said you could do length times width.  I would like everyone in the back row to sit down and pay attention.  Student I? This is something that Student As bringing to our attention. Length times width.  So, can you show us the length?  Come up here and show us our length. Excuse us, Student P.  Student A’s gonna come right behind you.  So, where’s the length?",teacher,102,6,,,0.0

"Well, I just want us to write down the formula in our notebooks and we’re running out of time.  So, what I’d like you to do is take out your math notebook.  Put the cubes back in the bucket.  And take out your math notebook.  You can just leave it in there. We don’t have time to take it apart.  We do have time to take notes, though.  So let’s not worry about taking it apart.  Student K?  Excuse me.  Freeze.  Five, four, three, two, one. Freeze.  Drop it into the bucket. Who is my collector?  Student C?  Collect them carefully.  Student I? Stop touching cubes.  Thank you, sir.  Everyone else is going back to their desks and writing down the formula.  I will erase the other stuff you aren’t supposed to write. You’re writing down the volume and the formula.  I asked you to write down the notes.  That’s about it.  Thank you, sir. Everyone else.  Notebook.  Did you write it down?  You wrote it down already?",teacher,168,3,,,0.0

"Measured in cubic units.  And this is an example.  Cubic inches.  Cubic centimeters.  Cubic feet.  Cubic yards. Okay?  It has to be cubic because it’s three dimensional. So, volume. We’re gonna start talking more about our 3-D objects and about the volume of those objects and become very familiar with how volume is determined.  How much space an object fills up, a 3-D object fills up.  Thank you, Student A.  And you can turn that one out and Number 3. So can anyone give me a wrap-up of anything they learned today about volume or our buildings?  Yes?  Student A?",teacher,100,10,,,1.0

So we’ll have more practice soon determining the volume of more buildings.  We’ll have practice in that.  We’ll do that more for [AYP] Math.  Okay?  Thank you very much.,teacher,29,1,1.0,,0.0
