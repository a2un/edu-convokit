So the Comforts, Mr. and Mrs. C, they decide to have a family reunion.  There are 32 people coming over, so they wanna make sure they have enough seating for all 32 people.  Now Mrs. C thinks she has a great idea.  She has a way that she has the seating all arranged and when we read it, you're gonna see what happens when more people come over, what they wanna do, which I really can't blame them.

The units used to measure area are based on units of length, but they are very different.  For example, if this was a one-inch square, the parameter would be four inches.  We're talking about a square, so the area for this square would be one square inch, okay, and we can write that by saying inch with a two above it, inch square.  Okay. The parameter of this square is one centimeter – one centimeter on each side – so the total parameter would be four centimeters.  The area we're talking about, that's a mistake.  The area is what?

No, I already got them there for you.",teacher,121,0,,,0.0
Twenty-four.,student,1,0,,,
"That a boy, good.  Now, I want you to figure out how many chairs could be seated there.  Thank you.  You can go back to your seat. [Crosstalk/0:35:25] Oh, snap.  Remember how – this is different than what you had.  That is what's on the board.  Going together and four separate. Michael went up to the board and put it up.[Crosstalk] Student M, Student A, do you see now?  Student D, is yours like that? When I come over, I'm gonna see that?  So that's – you know how many chairs?  [Crosstalk] Okay, Student A.  How many people can sit this arrangement?  It's basically a two by two, right?  How many people could sit here?",teacher,115,0,,,0.0
Eight.,student,1,0,,,
"Eight people, that's good.  So when we think about the parameter of this shape is eight.  These are inch square tiles, so we could say that this shape is eight inches, the parameter.  Oh, my pen isn't working again.  It was working so well.  Key word what, I already told you that, right? Come on.",teacher,55,1,,,0.0

Twenty-four.,student,1,0,,,
"Twenty-four.  So the total amount of chairs – or the total parameter for all of these shapes combined is twenty-four inches.  Are we good with that?  Now this is where the challenge comes. [Crosstalk]  How exciting. [Crosstalk] We already did Part A, so we're gonna go to Part B.  So you can fill in the top just so you have it there.  You know what I mean?  There you go bud.",teacher,71,2,,,0.0
Thank you.,student,2,0,,,
"You're welcome. [Crosstalk] Okay, everybody, let me have your attention.  Thank you Sarah, we're not having a festival right now.  Okay, so this is want you to do. [Crosstalk] Excuse me.  Everybody take a look so you'll know what you do.  And then groups that are doing their work and not fooling around are the groups that can go and use the [Inaudible]. Okay?  So let's just review this. At the beginning of the story, Mrs. C knew there would be how many people?",teacher,84,0,,,1.0

Eight.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Eight.  Put it there.  And how many at each table?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
Four.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Now we already talked about A, but let's just do it right now.  Just right here in this space, I just want you to draw eight tables and four at each table.  Okay, and if you want to to speed things up, if you feel comfortable with it, you can just write the number four.  If you still need to visually see it, then you can just put the four chairs just by lines around it, whatever you want.  And we should know that there will be thirty-two people. Now while reading the book – now let's talk about this.  Right here it says, ""The top of each small table has an area of one square unit.""  All right?  One square unit.  Our tiles, they're one inch.  The paper on your tables which I told you not to touch yet, that is one inch as well.  This will fit perfectly in this paper.",teacher,154,6,,,0.0
What?  Where?,student,2,0,,,
"On your desk.  Don't touch it yet.  You have one inch squared paper.  Your tiles fit perfectly in a square.  Okay, does everybody see that?  But don't touch the paper. So the total area – excuse me.  The total area – if I combine all of these squares, the total area would be eight square units. The total parameter – now I don't why that's moving. Student L, thank you.  The total parameter is thirty-two. An individual one – there's four will be combined under this thirty-two. Now this is what I want you to do.  You need to listen to directions this table, you will go last.  Show two other ways Mrs. C could have seated her guests.  And here's an important part.  She may have to rent more tables, so this is what I want you to do. I want you to come up with two other ways – stop playing with the tiles.  I don't like when people come up to me and say they don't know what to do, but you were doing something that you wanted to do.  Right now, you are listening to me. That's what I want you to do.  That's what you need to do so you know what to do.  I just said to do a lot, so pay attention.  All right. So you're gonna show two other ways Mrs. C could have seated her guests.  You can use more than eight tables.  You can use more than eight tables.  Once you have figured out a way with your tiles, I want you to take the inch squared paper which is on – don't touch it.  I want you to take the inch squared paper which is on your group's tables, and I want you to show me the shape.  Okay? Now just to let you know that one square – Student M, can I see you [inaudible].  [Crosstalk] So pay attention please.  So A, right?  In order to show A correctly, I'm gonna have it drawn – color in eight squares. Okay, I'm gonna have you color in eight squares, but I couldn't have drawn the lines without skipping a space because I have to show four people at a table.  So once you've made your arrangement, I want you to take that arrangement and I want you to color it on your square paper. If the squares are too big, on the back table I also have centimeter paper.  Now the centimeter paper is instead of inches, it's centimeters.  So it's smaller, but it's the same concept. So you could fit more on there if you needed to.

"Thirty-two, okay?  All right, go ahead. [Crosstalk]  There's inch squared paper there. [Crosstalk] Your stomach hurts, that's awful.  Why don't you do a shape and then we'll see how you feel in five minutes. [Crosstalk]  Make an arrangement.  You can use more than eight tables, so you can use more than eight tiles. [Crosstalk] I wanna see you working.  What did I say?  Groups that are working will go the [Inaudible]; groups that are sitting there, will not go to the [Inaudible].  [Crosstalk/0:47:53] I'm gonna put some centimeter paper at your groups in case you choose to use that if you need more room.

I did sixteen tables with two chairs.,student,7,0,,,
"He did sixteen tables with two chairs at a table.  That would equal thirty-two, but all the sides need to have a chair. All the sides need to have a chair.  Now in real life you are correct.  You could have just two people sitting at a restaurant, you're right about that.  But for this exercise, we're practicing parameter.  I want you to be able to count all the sides.  So all the sides need to be accounted for, okay Student J?  That was good though, I like that. Student B, you having a little dinner for two?  I understand, but we're doing it for four, okay? [Crosstalk]  Copy it down on your paper, color it in. [Crosstalk/0:51:20] Once you have one way, color it in on your paper and then do it a second way. [Crosstalk/0:53:27] All right, time out for a second.  Time.  I would like one person from each table if possible to come up and show me one way. Student G, come on up.  You will represent the middle group. Time out.  Maybe when you see an example, you'll understand why. You'll see it.  Student A, pay attention, okay.  Oh, this is like beautiful to look at.  All them colors reminds me of a [Inaudible]. All right Student G.  How many people are sitting at each arrangement?  So how many people are sitting at this group right here? Eight people are sitting at that group of tables, because – and I love how you wrote it.  I hope Student C and Student N were all looking up here.  We're seeing what she did.  She has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Each side represents a spot where a person can sit. So you have this line right there that I put.  That is where two different tiles work.  So that's like where two different tables could be.  Now Student D, we're not doing anything else Student D – excuse me – but paying attention. So you have eight people here.  So how many sets of tables does she have?  How many groups?  So who can give me a multiplication sentence that represents the parameter? Student M.",teacher,362,2,1.0,,0.0

In one group here, how many tables do you have? He has three tables at each group, correct?  At each group?  How many chairs?  Eight chairs.  So again, kind of like we have four sets a group, three in each group, so the parameter would be thirty-two – eight, sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-two.
