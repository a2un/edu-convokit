I’m putting it in front of you Student T so you can see it and understand it. If your body is not turned towards me, I’m assuming you’re not paying attention and you will get a consequence. So the information we just put up there, what do we know?  It’s all equivalent.  It’s equivalent.  So I’m gonna write on the board “equivalent.”  We talked about it once before.

Look at one of those squares and tell me how that’s related to percent.  There we go.  Out of 100.  What is – how is this square gonna help us with our percents?

She could have also written a fraction, one over two, one- half, correct? Now Student J, if he’s done, I want to show what he did.  He got all fancy.

"He did it this way.  He cut it in half diagonally; he colored in half the squares, which is fine and you’re gonna have to do for some other fractions we’ll be discussing where you’re gonna have to – I’m sorry.  [Inaudible].  There we go.  He just cut these not perfectly in half, which if he had a little steadier of a hand, he probably would have done better.  But he thought cutting in half that way, 50 percent.  So he cut squares in half, which, keep in mind, when we get into other fractions, you’re gonna have to cut the smaller squares in half or cut them into eighths or cut them into thirds.  So that is a perfect way. Let me see.  Label your squares so I can show different ways that people label them.  And Student V, perfect; cut it in half. So half is pretty easy.  50 over 100, 50 percent or half.  And we know also where I said split this up into three-sixths, he split it up to six equal groups and it’s the same amount would be shaded in, wouldn’t it?  We want to try to note one same size, but breaking it up different ways.  Picture this as a square piece so we’re breaking it up in different ways. So we’re gonna move on from 50 percent, which was pretty easy, wasn’t it?  The next square, I want you split into one-fourth.  So what do you need to do?  You’re going to split it into how many equal groups?",teacher,257,14,,,0.0

Don’t look at your neighbor. You think of your own way of doing it.  Shade in one-fourth of it though.  Then label it one-fourth.  I’ll write one- fourth on my paper so you know – or on the board – so you – ooh, I almost spilled my water.  One-fourth.  This is what I want you to shade in.  You just shaded in one-half, right?  You did that one.  Now I want you to shade in one- fourth.  One-fourth. Awesome.  Can you give me the percent for that? When you finish it, label it one-fourth, but also give me the percent.

No.  20; do four equal groups of 20 equal 100?  So let’s look at it.  You have this group of 20.  Well let’s say we shade another group of 20.  Now you are [inaudible].  So what’s the [inaudible]?

She knew one-fourth of 100 is 25; count them, 10, 25.  Filled it in.  She wrote this though.  Why did you write 75 percent?",teacher,83,1,,,1.0
