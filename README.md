<h1><img src="assets/logo.png" height="30" /> Edu-ConvoKit: An Open-Source Framework for Education Conversation Data </h1>

The **Edu-ConvoKit** is an open-source framework designed to facilitate the study of conversation language data in educational settings.
It provides a practical and efficient pipeline for essential tasks such as text pre-processing, annotation, and analysis, tailored to meet the needs of researchers and developers.
This toolkit aims to enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of educational language data analysis, as well as advance both natural language processing (NLP) and education research.
By simplifying these key operations, the Edu-ConvoKit supports the efficient exploration and interpretation of text data in education.

## Overview of the `edu-convokit` Pipeline

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/overview.png" width="600"/>
</p>


The **Edu-ConvoKit** pipeline consists of three key modules: `preprocess`, `annotate`, and `analyze`.
The pipeline is designed to be modular, so you can use any combination of these modules to suit your needs.
This pipeline has also been used by prior work in the field of education, so you can easily reproduce their results.
