Oh yeah.,student,2,0,,,
"Another one?  How many boxes did you do?  What we have left, we know what to do with.  You guys came up with a lot.  Two more minutes.  We're not going to spend too much time on this.  Okay.  The only difference that we have today when I ask you to come up to the board if you want to share, is if you just use the blue pen or the black pen.  Just when they're photographing the other colors, they don't show up too well, okay?  So let's first – because we did our unit with the fractions, let's start with the fractions first. Is there someone who wants to share an equivalent for a tenth that they wrote in fraction form?  Student R?",teacher,125,6,,,0.0
Two quarters.,student,2,1,,,
Can you go write it please?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Up there?,student,2,0,,,
"Mm-hmm.  Just use blue or black, okay?  Anyone else?  Student A, do you want to share?  What did you have?",teacher,20,0,,,1.0
One tenth.,student,2,1,,,
Okay.  Hold on.  I don't know what it's doing.,teacher,9,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Someone already got that.  Does anyone have an equivalent using hundredths?  I need one equivalent with hundredths.  If I have one tenth, how many hundredths would that be?",teacher,28,6,,,1.0
Ten out of a hundred.,student,5,1,,,
So if you looked at your first grid and you actually shaded it in – can I see this please?,teacher,20,0,0.0,,0.0
Mm-hmm.,student,1,0,,,
"You shaded in one tenth.  Over here you also shaded in one tenth, but you also shaded in ten hundredths because you shaded in ten squares out of the hundred squares.  What about thousandths, thousandths?  Student J.",teacher,37,8,,,0.0
One hundred thousandths.,student,3,2,,,
"Could you write that for us please?  So if I have one tenth, I have ten hundredths, I have a hundred thousandths.  Good. What's happening here?  What is happening with those specific equivalents?  Look at those four squares on your paper.  What's happening on mine?",teacher,45,6,,,1.0
You're multiplying by 10.,student,4,1,,,
"Multiplying by 10.  Anyone else?  Student R, is that what you were going to say?",teacher,15,1,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Student A?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
"That, or that goes to [inaudible] to the right.",student,9,0,,0.0,
"Multiplied by 10, okay, and I know some of you had four fortieths, five fiftieths, and so forth, but the main thing I wanted you to see was the tenths, the hundredths, the thousandths, and then I want to try ten thousandths. Student R.  You can just use that bottom space right underneath there.  By one tenth, ten hundredths, one hundred one thousandths, how do I say that one, Student B?",teacher,71,9,0.0,,0.0
One thousand ten – one thousand and ten thousandths.,student,9,3,,0.0,
"One thousand ten thousandths, good job.  Okay.",teacher,7,2,1.0,,0.0
"You could do it ten thousandths, [inaudible].",student,7,1,,,
"Good, definitely could.  That would get more difficult, but as you see, as you go I shade in certain portions.  I get in to those tiny, tiny boxes.  It gets a little more difficult to see, but they're still equivalents, and that's what's important.  So now—",teacher,46,1,1.0,,0.0
How could they [inaudible] all those tiny boxes?,student,8,0,,0.0,
"Now what I want to do is – let's just.  I have to erase.  What? It won't let me erase.  I don't know why.  I'll leave that up there just – oh, now it's disappearing.  Okay.  So you had a lot of equivalents which was great, but before this I want to save these ones for now, because those are the ones you're going to be using the most.  Now who wants to come up and share a way that you wrote it using percents, using percents?  Student A.  That's ten percent, correct?",teacher,93,4,0.0,,0.0
Oh no.,student,2,0,,,
Okay.  What?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Never mind.  I just lost it.  [Inaudible].,student,7,0,,,
"So if I look at any of my four gardens, is that percent going to change?",teacher,16,1,0.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Does it matter whether it's one tenth, ten hundredths, one hundred one thousandths?  It's all equal to ten percent. That's why I had you shade it in so you could see that. Anyone want to share how they wrote it in decimal form? Student J?  No?",teacher,46,6,,,1.0
Ten hundredths?,student,2,1,,,
How did you write it?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
"Oh, I don't know.  [Inaudible] one tenth.",student,7,1,,,
Want to try it?  Try it.  Let's see how he does.  Let's see if it comes out the same way.,teacher,20,0,0.0,,0.0
Do I just put it in the same one?,student,9,0,,0.0,
Just do it quickly like you're writing in your notebook. That's fine.  That's fine.,teacher,14,0,1.0,,0.0
I did that too.,student,4,0,,,
Okay.  So we can fix this.  Is that one tenth?,teacher,10,1,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Let's just make that decimal point a little bit larger so you can see it.  Try and do that, you know, when we're working on this unit.  Make sure I can see that, okay?  Is that one tenth?  Can you say it a little bit louder?  That's ten hundredths.  It's definitely an equivalent.  Anyone want to try and write it another way for me?",teacher,64,5,,,1.0
"Which one, type – like, this is one the number chart, how tenth all goes down the [inaudible], unless you went with like a hundred, and the most [inaudible]. That's how I wrote it.",student,34,2,,0.0,
"Right, and remember, you don't have to put that zero, but most of the time you will see it written that way.  So I have one tenth, ten hundredths.",teacher,29,2,1.0,,0.0
I've got one.,student,3,0,,,
What?,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
"This is [inaudible] one, and then you have the [inaudible].",student,10,0,,0.0,
That's right.  You can have it.,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
Oh right.,student,2,0,,,
"Just do it.  Just show us.  If it's not right, then we'll get it out.  Can you make that decimal point a little bit larger?  Good.  Put the pen down, then we'll discuss it. Okay.",teacher,35,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Don’t speak out.  What do we have up there?  What did Student A – I'm glad you did that, Student A, because I'm hoping that not me, one of your classmates, is going to tell you what the difference is of what you just put up there, because we touched on this the other day a little bit.  Student A, what did Student A just put up here?",teacher,68,0,,,0.0
Student A just put a whole.,student,6,1,,,
Student A put one whole.  Can you – which is one hundred percent.  One whole which would be in fraction form over there like that.,teacher,25,5,1.0,,0.0
Ten tenths.,student,2,1,,,
"Ten tenths, one over one, one hundred over one hundred.  Okay, so he gave us one whole.  Can someone explain to him so that he understands the difference in what he put up there, versus these two?  Student B.",teacher,39,4,,,1.0
Because one whole is larger than one tenth?,student,8,2,,1.0,
"One whole is larger than one tenth, or one one-hundredth, but can you explain the representation so that when he sees something written in decimal form, he knows if it's a part of a whole, or if it's a whole?  Who can help him out with that?  Want to try?",teacher,50,6,1.0,,1.0
"Because he put the one before the decimal, and added two zeros.",student,12,1,,1.0,
"Are you paying attention, Student A, to his explanation?  Say that again to him please.",teacher,15,0,1.0,,0.0
The one before the decimal. Oh. Something like that.,student,9,1,,0.0,
Do you remember now what was discussed the other day?  So what does it mean if I have a number on the left hand side of the decimal?  What does that mean?,teacher,32,1,1.0,,1.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"I want to make sure that you have it before we go on.  Student A, can you help explain that?  How do I know which is a whole piece, whole number, and what is a part of that whole?  How do I know?  By looking at this?  By looking here?  By looking here?  Student A, do I have a whole number here?",teacher,62,4,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,,,1.0
"Because after the decimal, that's where it goes to a part of a whole.",student,14,2,,1.0,
To the right of the decimal tells me it's a part of a whole.,teacher,14,2,1.0,,0.0
"Before the decimal, then add a number.  That means it's a whole.",student,12,3,,0.0,
"Add a number to this side, to the left of the decimal means a whole, and there isn't one.  What about here, Student A? Do I have a whole at all?",teacher,31,4,1.0,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
How do I know that?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
Because there's no one before the decimal.,student,7,1,,,
"There's nothing on this side of the decimal which means that I only have a piece of a whole.  Okay.  So Student A, do I have a whole here?",teacher,29,3,1.0,,0.0
"Yeah.  No, no.",student,3,0,,,
"Student M, do I have a whole here?",teacher,8,1,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
How do you know I have a whole?,teacher,8,1,,,1.0
Because there's a number before the decimal.,student,7,1,,,
"There's a number before the decimal, to the left of the decimal.  So that means I have one whole, and nothing else because what does the decimal point mean?  It means the word—",teacher,33,4,1.0,,1.0
And.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"And, so this means I have no whole, but I have ten hundredths of a whole.",teacher,16,3,,,0.0
"Oh, so I have to put the one before it?",student,10,0,,0.0,
"After, after.",teacher,2,0,1.0,,0.0
"If it doesn't have nothing before the decimal, you don't have to say and.",student,14,1,,0.0,
Right.  So what then—,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
"Yeah, that's how [inaudible], because I didn't—",student,7,0,,,
"What's the difference of what you put, and what I just changed it to?  What's the difference?",teacher,17,0,0.0,,0.0
"Isn't it the same? I put it in to the whole amount, in tenth.",student,14,2,,0.0,
"Right.  I actually have one hundredth one thousandths, which—",teacher,9,2,0.0,,0.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"These are all clues.  Right.  You had the decimal after the one, making it a whole, okay?  Good.  You sure you have that now?  Good.  Okay.  So now, here's what I want you to do.  You know how Mrs. W. is not great at drawing, but this is what we're going to do.  You have some number lines on the next page.  Is that page 17 I believe?",teacher,68,3,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"We're going to use those, and I'm going to draw one on the board.",teacher,14,0,,,0.0
Can we put our notebooks away?,student,6,0,,,
"Keep it out for now.  So I start at zero, and I end at two. Well the one that I'm doing, we're going to do something first, then you're going to do something on your next page, okay?  So I have a number line here that begins at zero, and ends at two.  Is two a whole number?",teacher,58,2,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Yes, okay?  Not a fraction, not a decimal.  So we've used number lines before.  Now what I want you to do is I'm going to give you – I'll put it over here.  It won’t let me – six tenths.  Please don't put your hands up, even if you have the answer.  Please don’t speak up.  Think about it yourself.  If you're not really sure, and you want to speak to a partner, you can.  Think about where would you place that on that number line?  Where would I place six tenths? Put your hands down for now.  I want everyone to have a chance.  Even if you're not sure, talk to someone if you need a little help.  All right.  Who thinks they know where they would put – I'm not going to have you put it up here right now.  I just want you to share with the class, where would I put six tenths, Student S?",teacher,159,7,,,0.0

It's to the half point between the zero and the one.,student,11,0,,0.0,
Next to the halfway point between the zero and the one.  Which side of the halfway point would I put it on?,teacher,22,0,1.0,,0.0
The right side?,student,3,0,,,
"The right side, why?",teacher,4,0,,,1.0
Because it's sixty [inaudible].,student,4,0,,,
"It's sixty what?  I said it was six tenths, but it would be 60? Sixty one hundredths, and how do you know that it would go next to the half?  Can anyone be a little more precise in explaining that, more specific?  You're right, but I want just a clearer reason for why I would put it there. Student L?",teacher,60,2,,,1.0
I don't know that the halfway point is fifty percent.,student,10,1,,0.0,
"Hold on.  Okay, so she knows that the halfway point would be fifty percent, which is—",teacher,16,1,1.0,,0.0
A half.,student,2,0,,,
"Which is a half, which is five tenths.  Thank you.  That's what I want.  We're dealing with tenths, so I want to think about it in tenths.  What could I do to my number line to be more specific?  So you know if this is five tenths, you're correct in saying that six tenths goes inside it, but what would be a more specific, or more precise way of demonstrating that in another way?  Student R?",teacher,76,6,,,1.0
Can I use the bathroom?,student,5,0,,,
Yes.  Student S?,teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
You could write all the points of the tenth.,student,9,1,,0.0,
"Oh, so I could break this down in to tenths, so I would have one tenth, two tenths, three tenths, four tenths.  My halfway mark, five tenths, six tenths, seven tenths, eight tenths, nine tenths, ten tenths are one whole, okay?  So now I can look at that more clearly, and I can say, yes, six tenths goes there.  I can label each one in tenths. Does everyone see that?",teacher,70,14,1.0,,0.0

Instead of me passing out all the cards, to save time, I'm going to put the numbers, the decimals that I want you to place, on the board, just to save time, okay?  But for right now, we're still using my number line.  We're not using the number lines in your book.  I'm going to put some more numbers up here, and I want some volunteers to come up and tell me where you would put these, and tell me what they are.  I'm not going to tell you what they are.  Okay.

Why can't we use the red or the green?,student,9,0,,0.0,
"It doesn't show up on the tape recorder, so they asked me to just use the blue and the black.  All right.  So before you place that one, what is a step you can take to make sure you're putting it in the correct place?",teacher,45,0,1.0,,0.0
I could try dividing it by fourths.,student,7,0,,,
All right.  She might divide – when she's looking at the one and going to the two she could divide it in to fourths. What would you do to divide in to fourths?  What would be your first step probably?  What did I do between the zero and the one?,teacher,50,3,1.0,,1.0

So then I would do – two tenths is a little bit smaller than twenty-five hundredths, correct?  So then three tenths, four tenths, here's my five tenths, six tenths, seven tenths would be a little bit smaller than seventy-five hundredths, correct?  So then my eight tenths would come right after, nine tenths.  I suppose my ten tenths would be one and ten tenths would be my two, correct?  So then would I then place my – is this then the same as this side?  The only difference is that Student A also labeled it in fourths, correct?  We got a little bit messy here just because we didn't have a lot of space, okay?  All right.  So here's what I want you to do.  I want you to take a look at page – is it 17?",teacher,176,15,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Page 17.  I'm going to put five numbers on the board, and I want you to – you can work with a partner, or if you want to work on your own that's fine.  Instead of passing out the cards, to save time, I'm just going to pick five numbers and put them up here.  You're going to place them on your number line.  Your number line is a little bit different than mine, okay?  So this should be easy.  One tenth, seven tenths, fifteen hundredths, forty-five hundredths, nine tenths.  Can you place them all on one number line?  I want them all on the same number line.  Use number line one.  If you want to work on your own you can. If you want to work with a partner – but I want you to take those five numbers and place them on your number line. Hurry up.  We only have five minutes, then we're going to move on.  Okay.

Would you come up and do one tenth, Student R?  One tenth, then we'll discuss some of the issues that we ran in to. Then once we finish with this activity, I found a pretty nice website the other night that gives a little bit of explanation on ordering decimals on a number line, then we'll go back to Dr. Nussbaum's website, and we'll have him place some numbers.",teacher,137,5,0.0,,0.0

Student B, can you explain as you're doing that where you're putting it, and why you're placing it there please? It's fine.  It's good enough.  Why are you putting it there, though?",teacher,82,6,,,1.0
Because [inaudible].  I just give them the same one.,student,9,0,,0.0,

"Because this is thirty hundredths, and this is fifty hundredths, so it has to be between, forty-five.",student,17,2,,1.0,
"Okay.  So he's saying he put this here because he knew this was four tenths, or forty hundredths, and my halfway mark is here, which is five tenths, or fifty hundredths, so he knew that forty-five hundredths had to come in between.  The last few were a little bit easier.  Student M, what was the next one?",teacher,57,5,1.0,,0.0
Nine tenths.,student,2,1,,,
"Nine tenths.  Could you place that for me please?  Okay.  So I know that one is equivalent to ten tenths, so nine tenths would be just to the left of that.  It would be one less. Student J, do you want to do the last one for us please? Seven tenths.  Good.  Okay.  Nice job.  I know a few of those are difficult, but some of you weren't sure, and you asked for help from me or someone else, and some of you were good enough to go around once you finished.  So let's look with comparing and ordering decimals.  When would I ever do that?  Okay.  So I think you'll like the first thing that comes up.  I know I kind of laughed a little bit when it came up last night.  McDonald's menu.  I'm lovin' it. [Laughter]  So remember, a lot of these websites are created by other teachers, so which – let's just look at a few of these items, okay?  I have my double cheeseburger. I have my Big Mac value meal.  So I have my McFlurry. Let's say I'm not sure if I want an ice cream cone, or a McFlurry.  Which one costs more?  Can you explain why to me, Student R?",teacher,208,7,,,0.0
You said—,student,2,0,,,
"I'm not sure if I want an ice cream cone, or if I want a McFlurry.  How do I know which one costs more?  Can you explain?",teacher,27,0,,,1.0
I think the McFlurry's more because it's $1.97.,student,8,0,,1.0,
"It's $1.97, and the ice cream cone is—",teacher,8,0,1.0,,0.0
Only 87 cents.,student,3,0,,,
"87 cents, so the ice cream cone has – there's no number to the left of that decimal point, is there?  There's no whole, so it's a little bit under a dollar.  Okay.  Did you have a comment, Student B?",teacher,40,2,,,1.0
"Yeah, but you already said that, because the one is before the decimal, it means there's more than one whole.",student,20,2,,1.0,
"Exactly.  So let's take a look at this one here.  Order up, least expensive, to most expensive.  So if I took all those items, which another day we'll probably do another activity similar to that, if we had more time I would have left that menu up, and I would have had you order them, line them up from least expensive, to most expensive.  So there's my ice cream cone, 87 cents, 99 cents.  I have two items that are the same price, then I go all the way up to my most expensive which is my chicken salad which is $4.80.  Four wholes, and my eighty hundredths, my 80 cents out of a dollar, okay?  What do I mean, compare decimals?  When we compare we use terms such as less than, greater than, or equal to.  Comparing decimals is similar to comparing whole numbers, believe it or not.  45 is less than 47, just as 150 is greater than 105.  When we compare decimals we use place value, or a number line.  What is it, Student M?",teacher,178,9,0.0,,0.0
Can I use the bathroom?,student,5,0,,,
"Yes.  Okay, so remember when we did something like this the other day?  I gave you a number, and then we had our – let's start with our whole before the decimal point.  so my whole numbers would be my ones, my tens, my hundredths, and my thousandths, and when I move to the right of the decimal I have my tenths, my hundredths, my thousandths, and my ten thousandths.  Remember, my thousandths is different than thousands, isn't it?",teacher,79,12,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Thousands are whole numbers.  Thousandths are not.,teacher,7,3,,,0.0
What is the ten thousands?,student,5,1,,,
"They just didn't go over that part.  They could have done that. They could have done ten thousands.  They could have done one hundred thousands.  They could have done a million, but you have enough, so these are numbers that you would deal with more on a daily basis than you would in the larger numbers, so they didn't feel it was necessary.",teacher,63,3,1.0,,0.0
"When I went to a store, and they had like, the table, and all the money was taped on, I saw a one million dollar bill on it.",student,28,0,,0.0,
"That's impressive.  Okay, so let's look at – we looked at a menu at McDonald's.  Now we're looking at half pipe results.  What's a half pipe?  We all know what a half pipe is, right?",teacher,35,0,1.0,,0.0
No. Yes. What? [Inaudible]. The half pipe's the card.,student,9,0,,0.0,
No.  Wow.  I'm surprised.  You know what?,teacher,7,0,0.0,,0.0
"Oh, I know.",student,3,0,,,
"Student A is in the boy's room, and Student A would know this for sure.  Student B?",teacher,17,0,,,0.0
"Those pipes that are connected to [inaudible], and they go to—",student,11,0,,0.0,
Nope.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
"Like these big, big pipes, and sometimes skateboard—",student,8,0,,0.0,
"Yes, skateboarders would call it half pipe.  Okay.  So remember the other day we were talking about races, whether someone's running track, whether someone's swimming, and we talked about this time.  What is it?",teacher,34,0,1.0,,0.0
Can I use the bathroom?,student,5,0,,,
"Yes.  So this is very similar to how that was represented the other day.  So I look at the half pipe results, and if I line them up by decimal points, I see their scores.  So if I start at the left, and I find the first place digits differ, and I compare those digits, I see that Sarah's score would be forty-two and one tenth, correct, versus Danny's score is forty-two and five tenths, or forty two and a half, which means Sarah's score was lower than Danny's score, okay?",teacher,91,6,0.0,,0.0
Can I go to the bathroom?,student,6,0,,,
"You'll have to wait until Student A comes back.  So here it is. They're representing it on a number line, okay?  So my forty-two, my whole number, and just like we broke down our number line, Student R, in to tenths, they're doing the same thing right here, forty-two and one tenth versus forty- two and five tenths.  Decimals that name the same number are called equivalent decimals.  Six tenths, sixty hundredths.  Are these the same?",teacher,76,11,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"We just did this, didn't we?",teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"We just did this.  Yes they are.  So let's look.  Again, we've used a number line, and we've used the grids, correct? Same representation.  Placing a zero to the right of the last digit in a decimal, although we added a zero, the value of the decimal did not change.  Annexing, or adding a zero is used to [inaudible] decimals.",teacher,60,6,,,0.0
What does annex mean?,student,4,0,,,
Add.,teacher,1,1,,,0.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  we can order decimals from least to greatest, or we can order them from greatest to least, so if I order 15, 14 and ninety-five hundredths, 15 and eight tenths, and 15 and one hundredth from least to greatest, it should look something like this.  That's not in order.  That's just showing you the numbers.  Now this one's placed in order.  They're trying to show you.",teacher,67,4,,,0.0
Just add a zero.,student,4,1,,,
That's right.  You add a zero if you want as we're placing them.,teacher,13,1,,,0.0
How is it – can you put it back?,student,9,0,,0.0,
I can't.,teacher,2,0,1.0,,0.0
How does 14 95—,student,4,0,,,
"Right here.  It's not.  They're going from least to greatest, so 14 and ninety-five hundredths is smaller than 15, 15 is smaller than 15 and one hundredth, and 15 and one hundredth is smaller than 15 and eight tenths, which you also know is 15 and eighty hundredths, okay?  So I'm going to start there for now.  What I want to do is just come over to, and do one of these quickly back on Mr. N's website.  He puts the decimals in order from least to greatest by dragging them.  We did this just the other day.  Who wants to come up and try and place the first one?  Student M, go try the first one.",teacher,117,6,,,0.0
Didn't we already do this one?,student,6,0,,,
"Not the same one, and if it is, it's not a big deal.  Okay.  So he said one and four tenths comes first.  Is he correct?",teacher,26,1,0.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Student A?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
Why is it the second one?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
"Oh yeah, because it's a whole.  It's right there.",student,9,1,,0.0,
Student R?,teacher,2,0,0.0,,0.0
"One and two hundredths. Tenths. Oh yeah, tenths.",student,8,3,,0.0,
"Two tenths?  Can you come up and put it in the right place? You don't need to move his because he left us enough space. See what you missed?  One and two tenths, then one and four tenths.  So what would come next, Student C?  Come up and try one.  Come up.  I can't see completely from there. Just don't go near the camera please.  What?",teacher,66,3,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
Two and four tenths comes next.  Lindsay?,teacher,7,1,,,0.0
She won't scoot over all the way.,student,7,0,,,
"That's fine.  The number line is big enough, so it's not a big deal that they're not exact.  If I wanted them precise, I'd let you know.  So two and four tenths, two and five tenths? Student S?  Three and nine tenths, Student A?  Four and eight tenths, Student A?  Five and one tenth, Student B? Five and seven tenths, Student J?  Six and six tenths, and that leaves what, Student L?  Come up.  Six and eight tenths.",teacher,78,9,0.0,,0.0
Can't they all get closer?,student,5,0,,,
Hmm?,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
I just think they need to get closer.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"No.  Okay, so for right now what I want to do is – did you represent decimals by using the number line?",teacher,22,2,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"You did more than that.  You represented them.  You represented fractions, and you represented percents.  Did you order the decimals and justify why you put them where you did?",teacher,29,3,,,1.0

And their equivalents?  Did everybody meet today's objective?,teacher,8,1,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Yes we did.,student,3,0,,,
