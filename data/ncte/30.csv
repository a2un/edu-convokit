"All right, boys and girls.  We’re going to continue our discussion about division, and we’re going to talk about remainders.  I want you to turn and talk with the person next to you, and I want you to come up with your own definition of “What is a remainder?” Go ahead.  Go ahead. You guys are working, [inaudible] working.  You’re still working.  Alright.  Come back.  What is a remainder? Student D?  What did your partner and you come up with?",teacher,80,4,,,0.0
A remainder is the numbers left out of a division problem.,student,11,2,,0.0,

"Okay.  We did do some work with that yesterday, and I’m going to move on to my next question.  We’re going to come up with, again, for math class today, we’re going to come up with what we think a remainder is.  You guys have started with a very good idea, so I guess yesterday’s lesson must have stuck.  So, up here, we’re going to try to get – after all of our work today, we can come up what do we think a remainder is.  So I have a word problem here.  Why is this a word problem?  Anybody know why this is a word problem? Does it have some element in it that makes it a word problem?  Why is this a word problem?  Student D?",teacher,128,2,1.0,,1.0

Numbers.,student,1,0,,,
"It has some numbers in it.  Okay.  So here – we’re starting with all great ideas of how and why this may be a word problem.  It says, “Farmer Brown needs to collect 122 eggs.

Why?",teacher,75,0,,,1.0
Because it doesn’t say how many baskets you need to have.,student,11,0,,1.0,
"Because it doesn’t say that or because it does say that?  Think about that, okay, while we come back.  Alright.  Come back to me.  Come back to me, [inaudible].  Thank you.

"Very good.  Did you hear what he said, everybody?",teacher,9,0,0.0,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"This is the most important part, Student W, because in a division word problem, the interrogative sentence tells us not only what our label is, but it tells us what to do with our remainder.  We need to think about our word problem. We need to think – let me ask you.  Is a basket that is split going to help us?  Can I break a basket in half?",teacher,69,2,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"Probably not.  So keep that in mind as we solve the problem. [Inaudible] solve the problem for you today, because we’re going to be working on them on our own, and the problem is here.

The eggs.,student,2,0,,,
"The eggs, Student T.  Very good.  Twenty baskets will only hold 120 eggs.  I can’t say, “That’s it, then I’m going to stop.”  I have 2 left over.  I have 2 eggs left over, so I have to do something.  Student M, what do I have to do?",teacher,48,0,,,0.0

Can’t [inaudible] do 6 times 4 [inaudible]?,student,7,0,,,
"That’s a very question.  Student A says, “Ms. H, well, you have 6 times 20 and I know that equals 120.  Why can’t you just do 6 times 2, which equals 12?”  Somebody tell Student A why that doesn’t work.",teacher,40,0,1.0,,0.0
"Because if you do 6 times 2, it will pass 122.  It’ll go to 132 instead.",student,16,0,,1.0,
"Very good.  See, Student A, I think what you need to realize is that when you 6 times 2, you are saying, “I am taking 6 groups times 2, 6 things times 2, and that’s where that 12 comes in.”  All right? You can’t get another group of 6 inside 122.  You’ve already gone too far.  Nice job explaining that, Student T.  You had 132. Even though you’re like, “Well, I only need 2 more,” but you’re not doing 2 more.  You’re doing 6 groups, 6 members times 2 groups.  Good question, though, because I’m sure other people had that question.  Student J?",teacher,103,0,1.0,,0.0

[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"No.  6 times 22 is 132, and Farmer Brown needed 122 eggs, all right?  Does everybody understand that?  All right.  So sometimes your remainder can be split, like if it was a cookie or a cracker.  And other times your remainder, you need to think about the word problem and you may have to add your remainder. Who remembers in the word problem that you couldn’t take the remainder and add one over, or you couldn’t split it in half.

Student T, I need you at that back table.  Student D, Student T, Student J, Student A.  Before I move on, are there any questions?  I’m leaving this up in case you get stuck.

So today we’re going to talk about a word problem that doesn’t have a remainder, and then we’re going to talk about a word problem that does have a remainder, and see if there’s a real difference.  Here’s a little story.  Actually, I’m giving you the number sentence, and we’re going to talk about writing a word problem.  Actually, I gave that to you too early.  I want your eyes up on my paper, because here is a word problem that kind of happened to me yesterday. The number is 42, divided by 6.  All right?  What’s this called?

Notice, again I started with the larger number, and then I put them in groups of 6, just the way it’s written right here.  So I want to take a look at your paper, and have somebody read me a story.

Well, let’s see.  Sometimes there are leftovers because this number is important in a division statement. It is called – it divides, it controls how many people can go into each group.  Listen.  It controls how many people can go into each group.  And because it can control how many people can go into each group, it’s very important, because it’s saying whether you have 40 cookies, 40 crackers – every time you have a group of three you count that as a group.  And so how many whole groups of three do we have?",teacher,129,4,,,0.0

13.,student,1,0,,,
"You have 13 whole groups of three.  But there is one whatever it is left over.  The remainder is always when? Whatever the number is does not fit evenly.  That’s why you need a remainder – when the numbers don’t fit evenly.  This is 13 whole groups of three – that’s what that means.  Just when you multiply – when you multiply 6 times 7 – that means you took 6 members in a group and you multiplied them 7 times and you got 42.  Okay?  The same thing here. That’s why you need a remainder.  So everybody understand the important parts of remainder?  Remainder is when there are extras left over because it did not go in evenly.  It’s not a whole group.  Somebody’s out.  Okay?  And the most important part is that sometimes that somebody that’s out can be split.  Sometimes that somebody can move out and cannot be split, and it’s important to remember that that is dependent upon the word problem.  Okay?  All right? So when we get back to chair, I hope somebody remembers what remainder is.  Finish this page and work on the next one. The next one gives you the problems to solve.

It controls how many members are considered into a whole group.  20 is saying that there are 20 groups of six in 120.  When you have a leftover or a remainder is when you cannot make a whole group of six.  It is the left over, it is the extra, when you cannot make an entire group of six.  This is a very important number in the division statement, because it controls how many whole numbers can be counted off, and leftovers, remainders, are where there are not – there cannot be any more.  There cannot be any more groups made. Okay? So you are right.  The remainder is the leftover.  It is the extra. It is counted out because it cannot be put into a whole group.  It cannot be put into a whole group.  I like that. It’s counted out because it cannot be put into a whole group.  I want you to go, counted out, because you can’t be put into a whole group.  Okay?
