"Red.  It’s red, okay.  Okay.  Boys and girls, you can put this away, okay, ‘cause we’re going to get started on our math. So go ahead and put this away and make sure that if you still have the glossary words to look up that you put those in your book bag today.  And you look up here and you check on your homework oh, glossary words.  But we’ll stop math like we always do at 2:15 so you can copy this down.  So don’t worry about copying it now. All right, now all I need is for you to take out your math journals – your math journals and we’ll get started.  What are you doing?  Okay, come over – go over there. Okay.  Math journals on your desk, please.  Everything else can be put away.  We will be using the big books but not yet.  So you can put everything else away so that you just have your math journal out and you’re all set to go.  Okay, let me see who’s ready.  Student, you have something under your desk, honey, like a stickum or something.  Student Y, you ready?",teacher,192,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  I know it’s Monday but wake up.  It’s math time, your favorite time, right?  All right, so for the next few days we’re going to be working on multiplication problems, okay? Don’t worry about the camera.  There’s nobody operating it; it’s just going to be there.  You’ll forget about it in a few minutes so don’t worry about it, just do what you always do, what you normally do.  You’re going to be solving multiplications problems and we’re going to be talking about strategies that we use to break the problems down. Yes, we’ve done a little bit of this so this should be very familiar to you. The only difference is that today we’re going to be giving you a set of problems and we’re going to be asking you how they’re related and we’re going to ask you to choose some of the problems to make your strategies from that set of problems. And what that is is that’s called multiplication clusters. So up until now we’ve been sharing some strategies of how to break down bigger multiplication problems, how to solve the bigger problems using the break down method, right?",teacher,194,4,,,0.0
Uh-huh.,student,1,0,,,
And you’re getting pretty good at that.  And this is the same idea except that we give you a set of numbers and you choose the numbers that are related to each other.  You choose the two numbers that are going to help you to solve the bigger number.  Did you do this a little bit in third grade?,teacher,59,0,,,1.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No?  You don’t remember?  All right, so let me give you your first example, and I want you to copy this down in your journal, okay? [Long pause]  Okay, I’ll give you second to copy this down.  [Long pause] Okay.  So what I want you to do first is I want you to do first is I want you to solve these first four problems, okay?  So I’m going to give you a couple minutes to solve these first four problems.  And then what you’re going to do is choose one or two of these problems that help you to solve – to get you to the final problem, thirteen times eight.  So it’s just like what you’ve been doing, like you’ve been breaking it down with your own strategies, but now I want you to look at these four, solve them, and choose one or two that you would use to help you solve this final one. Okay, Student J, you got it?  So solve these four first. [Long pause]  Put your equal sign. Student C, you’re solving these four problems first.  [Long pause] Yeah, so put your total.

Twenty-two.,student,1,0,,,
"Yeah, put it there.  [Long pause]  Now I’m noticing that some of you have already solved your four problems.  Once you finish solving these four I want you to choose one or two of these, probably two, right, that will help you to solve this final problem, thirteen times eight. [Long pause]  Give you about one more minute to solve.  Some of you are still solving the four problems.  Now, Student B, choose a couple of these that you’re going to use.  Which ones did you choose to help you solve that?  You didn’t show that.  I want you to show me.",teacher,102,0,,,0.0

Thirteen times two.,student,3,0,,,

Thirty. Twenty-five.,student,2,0,,,

I’ve seen a lot of you using this strategy, but I love how I’m seeing you use other strategies too.  Especially those of you who are remembering the doubling and the halving, that’s good to see.

Student S, do you see this.  And in the model that you’re going to share with the class you’re going to choose the final, right?  Four times – in this case it was four times forty-three.

They’re right over there on the ones that you did before a couple of weeks ago.  See what we remember with that.  And show our equation underneath the array.

So you’ll put the final up top, show the strategy you used, and then make your array. All right, so here’s the deal.  I want to just go over making the array real quick.

We’re imaging here – two – that there’s four across, one, two, three, four, and then forty-three going down.  But we don’t have to take the time to draw all that in.  But that’s what we’re seeing in our minds.  You’re seeing, right -- look up here, Student J.  You’re seeing one, two, three, four, and then if we were going to draw these in we’d have forty-three.
