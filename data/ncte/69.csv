"Okay, class, good morning; could you guys share with me what we worked on yesterday in math class?  Student M.",teacher,20,0,,,1.0
We worked on my hundreds book – I mean thousands book.,student,11,2,,0.0,
"We worked on our thousands books, so who can tell me what we did with our thousands books?  Student J.",teacher,20,2,1.0,,1.0
We looked at numbers in the one and hundreds and [inaudible].,student,11,1,,0.0,
"So you marked the star in the end of each, of each chart? Excellent.  Well, yesterday we talked about naming them, like page one, page two – what I need us to do now is have a different way of referring to each page.  We are gonna be talking about what hundreds chart we’re talking about, so right now, I want you all to find the number 541.  541. Once you’ve found it, please circle it in your book.",teacher,79,2,1.0,,0.0
Wait – what was the number?,student,6,0,,,
"541.  Okay, Student N, will you please put it up on my thousands book?  Can you share with the class the strategy you used in finding it?",teacher,27,1,1.0,,1.0
"Well, I used the 500 one, then I went all the way to the first 5, and I counted –",student,20,0,,0.0,
You can write those numbers in if you want.,teacher,9,0,0.0,,0.0
"505, 550, 525, 535, 545, and then that this is the one, right there, so it’s 541, so I knew that that would be right here [inaudible].",student,27,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  So who can tell me, what did Student N use as like a method to find the placement of 541?  Student J?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,1.0
I think she used the landmark number.,student,7,0,,,
And what was her landmark number?,teacher,6,0,1.0,,0.0
5.,student,1,0,,,
5 – so her multiples of 5.  Excellent.  Who – did anyone do something different?,teacher,15,1,,,1.0
[Inaudible],multiple students,1,0,,,
Student C.,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
"I did when I got up to 500, I counted 4 down.",student,12,0,,0.0,
"So you got to the 500, then you counted –",teacher,10,0,1.0,,0.0
4 down.,student,2,0,,,
"So like 511, 21, 31, 41?",teacher,6,0,,,1.0
"You said go for 1, 41 – I mean 541, and then I knew it was in the ones, so I counted them down.",student,24,0,,0.0,
"So you used what you already had in your book – you used the 501.  Excellent.  Thumbs up if that was pretty easy. Great.  Who can tell me what hundreds chart 541 is on? Really think about it, because it can be a little confusing, so if you need to go back to the first page and say, “Okay, this is the blank chart.  The next page is the next chart,” ‘cause we call it a particular chart based on one number on that page.  Student H?",teacher,87,1,1.0,,0.0
"It’s called the 600s chart, because on this page that we’re supposed to be doing it says in the directions, “The chart that ends in 400 is called the 400s chart.”",student,31,0,,1.0,
"You’re just ahead of the game there, Student H, ‘cause we’re not even looking at page 2 yet.",teacher,18,0,0.0,,0.0
"But right here, it ends in 600, so this is the 600s chart.",student,13,0,,0.0,
"Okay, excellent, Student H; you summed up at the end.  You call the chart – you call the chart by the last number on the page.  So if everyone could find 500 – 752.  I want everybody to find 752.  Once you’ve found it, circle it. Okay.  Student J, how do I write 752?",teacher,54,1,1.0,,1.0
"You write 7 [inaudible], the next one a 5, the last one is 2.",student,14,0,,0.0,
And why is that?,teacher,4,0,0.0,,1.0
Because that the hundreds number is the 7.,student,8,1,,1.0,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
"The tens number is the 5, and the ones number is the 2.",student,13,0,,0.0,
"Excellent.  Great, because an important part of this unit is using that language; using the hundreds, tens, ones, and really like focusing on how we talk about our numbers.  Now who would like to tell me how they found 752?  Student A.",teacher,42,2,1.0,,1.0
"Well, it’s right here on the charts, and –",student,9,0,,0.0,
So what hundreds chart are you on?,teacher,7,1,1.0,,0.0
800.,student,1,0,,,
"So thumbs up if you are on the 800s chart.  Isn’t that what Student H said is the last number on that page, 800?",teacher,24,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, great – so keep going.",teacher,6,0,,,0.0
"Then I found 750, and I went down where it said 760, and I went to the second box.",student,19,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  So, again, so you went down to the 800, so 7 – actually, Student A, come here.  Show us up here – which one – so this, the 600 – 600 – so think about how Student N did it. How did she organize her numbers when she went up, because yesterday we only partially finished this chart?  So now share with the class how you just found 752.",teacher,70,0,1.0,,1.0
"I went to 760, and I counted a minus 8.",student,10,0,,0.0,
"Okay, but who can tell me, what did she do when she went up there?  Student E.",teacher,17,0,1.0,,1.0
"At first it looked like she was kind of confused at first, but then she found the 710 column, the 710, and then she counted until she got to 760, and she looked for the second box – for the first box, I think, and then she looked at the second box, and then she found 772.",student,57,0,,0.0,
"So she went all the way – so were you confused, or what was challenging when you went up here?",teacher,20,0,1.0,,1.0
I forgot like what I was looking for there.,student,9,0,,0.0,
"So because it’s not numbered.  So like Student N, when you went up there, did you feel a little bit of a challenge because you had to figure out where the numbers were and where we left off?",teacher,38,0,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, and so you did your multiples of 5, and what did Student A do?  She used her –",teacher,19,1,,,0.0
Multiples of 10.,multiple students,3,1,,,
"Her multiples of 10 – thank you, Student A.  Did anyone do it differently?  Did anyone find their number differently? Student O, how’d you find 752?",teacher,26,1,,,1.0
I did the same thing as Student N.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so share it with us.",teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
I went to 701 and went down.,student,7,0,,,
So you went to 701 – okay.,teacher,7,0,1.0,,0.0
And I counted all the way to 751.,student,8,0,,1.0,
"So you went down, so 701, 711, 721, 31, 741, 751, and then you went over?  Okay – did anyone do it that way?  Student M, how’d you find it?",teacher,30,0,1.0,,1.0
"No, I didn’t do it this way, this [inaudible].",student,9,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so you did it the same way.  Student R, how’d you find it?",teacher,14,0,1.0,,1.0
"Since I had my fives coming down, my fives, I went to 755, and then I went back three spaces, and then I got 752.",student,25,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so you used your multiples of 5, and then you kind of subtracted?  Now, I have a question for you guys, so I want you all to put your finger on 752.  So I have two or three really important questions that you need to think about while we’re doing this unit, ‘cause we had some difficulty with these questions in the last math test we took.  And it wasn’t because you don’t know it; it was just how it’s phrased.  We’re used to using the word “rounded” a lot, but we’re not using the word “rounded.”  We’re using words “nearest.”  So I want you all to look at 752, and I would like to know what number is your nearest ten?  So Student J did a nice job of saying 7 is in the hundreds, 5 is in the tens, 2 is in the ones.  So please look at 752.  What ten is it close to?  Student N?",teacher,160,4,1.0,,0.0
750.,student,1,0,,,
So are there options?  So you say 750.,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
"And I think that because – I think because last year, it was like this middle number, and it would even be 750 in the middle, and then 7 – wait.  It was something like that, but it was one in the middle.  750 was in the back, and 760 was in the front.",student,54,0,,0.0,
"Who agrees with Student N, that if you have 752-something, you’re closer to 750 than 760?",teacher,16,0,1.0,,1.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"755 is in the middle, and so ones, the number in the ones is the one that is a rounder, so 2 is less than 5, so it would be 750.",student,31,0,,1.0,
"So I want you all to look at that with your books.  So if you’re at 752, could everyone put in – can everyone see how 752 – did anyone notice anything when you put your finger on 752 in some of your books?  Student C?",teacher,46,0,1.0,,1.0
"There are only two spaces back from the [inaudible], but when you go to 76 you’re 8 spaces away.",student,19,0,,1.0,
"Okay, so you’re 8 spaces away.  Okay, so it’s what – so it’s away.  So if there were –",teacher,19,0,1.0,,0.0
"Right, and closer.",student,3,0,,,
"So if there’s more away – so there’s 8 away from 760, so that’s a big gap, and there’s a smaller gap between 750?",teacher,24,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
Okay.  Anyone else wanna share why they think it’s closer to 750?  Student M?,teacher,14,0,,,1.0
Because it takes more [inaudible] the 60 [inaudible].,student,8,0,,1.0,
"Okay, excellent.  My last question I want us to focus on is what is your nearest hundred?  So if you were at 752, what hundred are you closest to?  Hold on – you know what, I’d like you to share this with your neighbor, and why – there might be three.",teacher,51,2,0.0,,0.0
[inaudible] you’re [inaudible] away from 800.,student,6,0,,,
So what do you think 752 is closer to?,teacher,9,0,0.0,,1.0
I think 800. I think it’s closer to 755.,student,9,0,,1.0,
"We’re dealing with hundreds, so is it closer to 800 or?",teacher,11,1,1.0,,0.0
"I think it’s 800 because 52 is more than one of 50, and then 50 up is closer to the one that’s [inaudible].",student,23,0,,1.0,
"So you’re saying 752 is closer to 800 than it is to 700.  So how – ‘cause you remember when Student N – well, when Student C was saying there’s 8 steps from 752 to 760, how far away from 700 are you when you’re at 752?  You’re at 752 – how –",teacher,53,0,1.0,,0.0
48.,student,1,0,,,
"Oh, 48 to get to –",teacher,6,0,,,0.0
800.,student,1,0,,,
And how many to get to 700?,teacher,7,0,,,0.0
52.,student,1,0,,,
52.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
And 48 is less than 52.,student,6,0,,,
"Okay – Student T, StudentB, what do you guys think?",teacher,10,0,0.0,,1.0
"I think that it’s closer to 800, because if you’re saying in the 50s, like with 750, you’d be close to 700 and 800. Anything past 750 is more close to 800.",student,32,0,,1.0,
Okay.  What’d you guys think?,teacher,5,0,1.0,,1.0
I’d say 800 ‘cause [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
Did you all agree?,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"And 52 is more than like 50, so it would be 800.",student,12,0,,1.0,
"Okay, [inaudible].  Okay, so this is what I heard – I checked in.  It looked like every group was checked in with.  So because, Student T, we’re dealing with hundreds, our options, I heard, were either it’s either closer to 700 or it’s closer to –",teacher,46,1,0.0,,0.0
800.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"800.  And I really like the reasoning, because you guys are using Student M, what Student M was saying earlier, what Student C was saying, in what’s left.  So StudentK was saying 752 is closer to 800 because there’s 48 numbers to get to 800, but there were 52 numbers to get back to 700. So you have a shorter distance to 800.  Thumbs up if you also said the same thing.  This is the kind of discussion I wanna be hearing.  When I walk around and we’re working, I wanna hear you talking about the hundreds.  I want to hear you talk about the tens.  I want you to be using your landmark numbers, and all the teachers in the room, we expect to hear that type of language when we’re walking around, okay?  So your job today is to finish page two. Student H has already done a nice job reading the beginning of it.  I would like everyone to read the directions, so please put your finger where it says “find the numbers.” Please read the directions and start working.",teacher,183,2,,,0.0
[inaudible] elbow.,student,2,0,,,
"Know what, sweetie?  I asked you both to do some work, and I would appreciate it if you did that, and don’t worry about your desks.  You know what?",teacher,29,0,,,0.0
But the desk keeps hitting my elbow.,student,7,0,,,
"You know what – then you’re gonna sit right here.  Okay.  So you need to double-check all that, ‘cause is this right? ‘Cause none of you were supposed to do this.",teacher,31,0,1.0,,0.0
I’m on our 900 chart.,student,5,0,,,
"Oh, good.  Are we working on this right now?  Thank you.",teacher,11,0,1.0,,0.0
‘Cause that is saying 45 is one of –,student,9,0,,1.0,
"Which chart?  Is it on the hundreds, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s chart?  So find 45.  Everyone freeze – everyone freeze. Who can tell me what they should be doing right now?  I would like to hear what you should be doing.  Student J.",teacher,43,1,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
So what are you doing like for number one?  How do you solve number one?  Everyone stop – I said freeze.  No one should be talking to anyone.  Your ears and eyes should be at Student J.,teacher,37,0,,,0.0
"I solved number one because I looked at number 45, and I looked at the end of the chart, and it’s in the hundreds chart, so I put 45 is on the hundreds chart.",student,34,2,,0.0,
Excellent.  Did you circle 45 in your book?  Even if a lot of you already have it because you skip-counted by 5s. Excellent.  Who would like to try to do number two?  Number two.  StudentK.,teacher,35,1,1.0,,1.0
The 900s chart.,student,3,0,,,
"Oh, you’re on three.  Okay, that’s okay – we don’t wanna – so everyone look at three; it’s right below one.  So 850 is on the –",teacher,27,0,,,0.0
900s chart.,student,2,0,,,
"The 900s chart, so did you find 850 in your booklet?  Is everyone going to 850 in their book?  Did we all circle it?",teacher,24,1,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Remember the discussion – 850, what’s your – you have to be asking yourselves those questions.  Where’s your nearest ten?  Where’s your nearest hundred?  So don’t just put the numbers in the book; be thinking about where it fits; which ten is it closer to, which hundred is it closer to.  Okay, please continue working.",teacher,56,2,,,0.0
"[Inaudible] what to do, ‘cause one is [inaudible].",student,8,0,,0.0,
Nice – that’s a good strategy.  That should really help you; nice job.,teacher,13,0,0.0,,0.0
I just gotta do two more.,student,6,0,,,
"But Student R, I haven’t seen you thinking about what tens it’s closest to.",teacher,14,0,0.0,,0.0
The tens?,student,2,0,,,
Yep.  Yes.  So where –,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
"100 and 200, then 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800 – 900, and then a thousand, right?",student,17,1,,0.0,
"When you all finish.  And you know what, Student T, you’ve got a little bit of a problem.  So you found all these numbers? Where’s 192?",teacher,26,0,0.0,,0.0
Right here.  192.,student,3,0,,,
"You know what?  When I come back, I want you to follow directions.  You’re supposed to be in [inaudible].  You’re supposed to [inaudible] circles.  There are some long inserts.",teacher,29,1,,,0.0
"Who, me?  [Inaudible].",student,3,0,,,
"No, you’re not.  Before you go into this page, since you’re all kind of – I need you all to go through the numbers and ask which one is the nearest ten, okay?  And you can record it down here, okay?",teacher,41,0,,,0.0
The nearest ten is 400 – is 400.,student,8,0,,0.0,
"45?  What’s everyone go to 45.  Everyone go to 45.  Please – please go to 45 in your books.  Yes.  Is that closer to 40, or is it closer to 50?",teacher,31,0,0.0,,0.0
50. There’s no 50 [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
"No, no, it’s not the fifties chart.  I’m asking you an additional question if you’re really thinking.",teacher,17,1,0.0,,0.0
It is [wake].,student,3,0,,,
"Yeah, it’s in the chart, but do you guys understand me?  I’m asking you some questions that you need to be thinking about as you work, okay, since you are done earlier. You’re doing that.  Okay, I’m gonna repeat myself with this group.  You can’t work on this until you have gone through all the charts.  Why are you copying?  I need to make sure that – I see that you guys are whizzing through this.  I need to make sure that you’re asking yourselves which ten is it close to, so let’s – can you all put your finger on number six?  I want you all to put your finger on number six – 467.  Everyone find 467.",teacher,119,0,,,0.0
I know it’s [inaudible].,student,4,0,,,
"You know what, sweetie – hold on.  Does everyone have 467 and circled it?  467 – what is your nearest ten?",teacher,21,1,,,0.0
"470. 470, yeah.",student,3,0,,,
Are you all in agreement that it’s closer to 470?,teacher,10,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, what’s its nearest hundred?",teacher,5,1,,,0.0
It’s nearest 500.,student,3,0,,,
"Okay.  So I need you to go through, and on your paper, look for me – on your paper, you can write the nearest ten and the nearest hundred – that’ll be awesome – before I give you the extra paper.  Yes?",teacher,42,1,,,0.0
"I noticed that 45 is on the 100s chart because that you can see this, you can see the 100, and because this one’s before the 100 and this ones in the 200s because the 100s is before 200s.",student,39,0,,1.0,
"Oh, great – so it’s always, it’s kinda the hundred before?",teacher,11,1,1.0,,0.0
Um-hmm.,student,1,0,,,
"Oh, cool – that’s a great thing to have sort of thought about.",teacher,13,0,,,0.0
I didn’t need this.,student,4,0,,,
"Okay, but it’s really, really, really helpful, okay?  I want this to be a tool.  So often in this unit people forget about it, and it’s so helpful.  Like for example, have you done – please find 467 again.  All right, are you guys done?  Are you doing [inaudible] math? [Inaudible], I am. Are you – so what – so I’ve asked you to think about two questions, okay?  So Mr. T, if people are done, right before, right before that, they need to be recording their number to the nearest ten – so StudentK, please sit down; I don’t see a hand up.  So for example, 467, please find 467. Did you write what’s the nearest ten to 467?",teacher,120,1,,,0.0
The nearest ten to [inaudible].,student,5,0,,,
What’s the nearest ten?,teacher,4,0,1.0,,0.0
It’s [inaudible].,student,2,0,,,
That’s not a ten.,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Oh – 70.,student,3,0,,,
"So write that right in here – 470, okay?  So you guys can do this, the second part, together.  So did you find?",teacher,23,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  So for some of you that are finishing, I would like you to go and ask yourselves the two questions: what is my nearest ten, what’s my nearest hundred?  So for 467, what’s your nearest ten?  Use your book.",teacher,40,1,,,0.0
I’m finished.,student,2,0,,,
467 – what’s your nearest ten?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Nearest ten?,student,2,0,,,
"Find it in your book – just find it in your book first. So do you want them to move on to – I just want some – I told them to do it, because I thought it would be – Yeah.  They’re moving so fast, but they’re not thinking.  I need them to –",teacher,55,0,,,0.0
"470, because you need three more, and you need seven more to go back.",student,14,0,,1.0,
"Okay, 470, and then for the nearest hundred.",teacher,8,1,1.0,,0.0
Wait – I forget like –,student,6,0,,,
"For 467, what’s your nearest hundred?  Look what we did for –",teacher,12,1,0.0,,0.0
"Oh, I know – 500.",student,5,0,,,
Good job; okay.  So write –,teacher,6,0,0.0,,0.0
Because you only need 43.,student,5,0,,,
"So write 470, and write 500, okay?",teacher,7,0,0.0,,0.0
But we gotta do that for all of them?,student,9,0,,0.0,
"Yeah.  It’s gonna be quick, because you’re quick, and then it’s ones that are fun. So did you want them to [inaudible]. You know what, I’m really disappointed at you guys, because I gave you explicit instructions that you were not to touch this until you wrote both numbers underneath every number. So yeah, I told them they couldn’t even touch it unless they wrote the nearest ten and the nearest hundred. All right.",teacher,74,1,1.0,,0.0
And thousand.,student,2,1,,,
"But they like to do what they wanna do. We did talk about that. They’ll rush – through all ten?  Great, that’s good practice. We’ll continue to [inaudible]. Yes. Which is your nearest – did you write down [inaudible].",teacher,39,0,,,0.0
Mm-hmm.,student,1,0,,,
Nope.  So what’s the nearest hundreds of 45?,teacher,8,1,,,0.0
I think it’s a ten thousand ten hundred – ten thousand.,student,11,3,,0.0,
"You know what, number one’s hard.  Is 45 – do you think zero or a hundred?  What’s 45 closer to, zero hundreds or 100?",teacher,24,2,1.0,,0.0
Zero hundreds.,student,2,1,,,
"It’s just that’s the hard one, when there’s nothing, but like the zeros are closer.  See, Student D was – he started recording the answers. So the nearest ten. Okay, so did you write the nearest tens? Okay. So 45 – is 45 closer to 40 or 50?",teacher,48,0,,,1.0
Both.,student,1,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,,,1.0
"I have the same thing, because if you take away 5 and then add 5.",student,15,1,,1.0,
So is there a special rule when you’re at a 5 – when you’re halfway?,teacher,15,0,1.0,,0.0
You always go up.,student,4,0,,,
"Yep, you always go up – good job.  So try 50.  So go through all the numbers and find what their nearest ten is, and then find the nearest hundred.  How we doing?  Did we find – nice job.  I’ll give you your – you [inaudible], right? So think about it.  So zero hundreds or 100 – what’s 45 closer to?",teacher,61,2,,,0.0
"Zero hundreds. Zero, because 50 is half of a hundred, and that’s less than half.",student,15,2,,1.0,
I know it seems kind of weird because it’s –,teacher,10,0,0.0,,0.0
"So it’s zero, right? It was supposed to be 50.  The closest ten is 50.",student,15,0,,0.0,
Nice job.  Great job.,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0
I can’t do thousands.,student,4,1,,,
You’re really – so your tens are awesome.  Your hundreds – so 45.  Is 45 closer to 40 or 50?,teacher,20,1,,,0.0
It’s right in the middle.,student,5,0,,,
"What happens when you’re right in the middle?  So some people look at it like this little – like you’re on a mountain, okay?  And here’s your zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and then your next number.  What happens if you’re on the top of the hill?  Is your momentum pushing you kind of forward?",teacher,60,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"So when you’re at 5, you’re right in the middle; you go up.  So if you were at 45, you’re closer to 50 than you are 40.",teacher,27,0,,,0.0
"Oh.  So it’s down to [inaudible]. I’m having trouble with that too, ‘cause I understand that the nearest hundred is 800, but what’s the nearest ten?",student,26,1,,0.0,
"Well, can you – it’s just like you go back to this.  So –",teacher,14,0,0.0,,0.0

"So when you’re finding the nearest hundred, the number you’re dealing with should have a zero, because they’re hundreds. So 375 – is 375 closer to 300 or 400?  Okay, so – is 900 closer to 900 or 1,000?  Find 903 in your book and tell me. Okay, so you’re –",teacher,51,2,,,0.0

So the second piece – and where’s your paper – so the second piece – Student E, can you stop for a second? The second piece is answering those two questions, what is my nearest ten?  What is my nearest hundred?  Oh, good – so if you’re at 45, which is your nearest ten?  And so find 45 in your book.  You too – find 45.  45.",teacher,127,1,,,0.0

"No, you don’t want that – so you round up, okay?  So what I would like you guys to do first is find all your – round them all to ten.  Okay, so if you guys are done, so I want you to take your book, open up your math [inaudible] books. I want you to – okay, I want you to write ten addition sentences you could use – oh, you’re [inaudible].  You’re working that.  If you’re done with this – she’s not done. When you’re done with this, I want you to write ten addition sentences and ten subtraction sentences, and then you switch with each other and you have to solve, using numbers in your book.  So you would use numbers with three digits, okay?  What’s up? For this one, between 119 and 125 as the multiple of the numbers? Yep. Were you thinking of like 11 times 11 is 121, or were you doing like 122, like 22 is 11? A multiple – a multiple of 11 is when you skip down by 11, or it’s a number that you get when you multiply by 11. I didn’t know if that – so that would be like 2 times 11, like that’s what I was thinking of, but I don’t – Oh, no – it’s – yeah.  So you multiply 11 – 11, 22, 33.  Is that what I asked you?  So you guys are making problems for each other to solve?  So Student E, ‘cause I know I just came and sat with you guys to go over what you were supposed to do, right?  So this is a little disappointing. Are you really – you’ve had your hand up, all of that time, wasting, when you could’ve done this?

900.,student,1,0,,,
Why?,teacher,1,0,,,1.0
"Because 900 isn’t mostly really that much of a ten, and plus it’s in the hundreds column, and even though that it’s closer, it looks like it is kind of like the closest ten, but it’s really not, since you said like a ten, it could be like a 20 or something.  You could still go to 910, and that would be the nearest ten, and –",student,67,1,,1.0,
"Let me – let’s backtrack for a second.  So we’re at 903, and do you agree – do you agree that it is closer to 900, the nearest ten?  So if someone gave you 903 dollars, and they said, “Okay, do you have 900 dollars, or do you have closer to 910 dollars,” do you agree with the reasoning that you’re only 3 away from 900?  Okay.  So now let’s move to the hundreds, ‘cause we’re talking about is 903 – which hundred is it nearest to?  So use your books – use your books.  What are the two options that you’re trying to figure out?  Is 903 closer to this hundred, or that hundred?  So what are two options?

"So this – so there’s no ten, so but if this number was a 5 or higher – and how many of you had that discussion?  “Miss T, but it’s 5 away from here and 5 away from there – where do I go?”  And all of you said you go where?",teacher,52,0,1.0,,1.0
"You go to 1,000, because 50 – yeah, 50 [inaudible] equals – well, 50, the – 100 is – 50 is half of 100.",student,24,0,,1.0,
"So even though there’s an equal amount from 900 to 50 and 950 to 1,000, because you’re at 50, you’re already at, you know, you’re already up there, so you round it up.  You don’t go back.  But what you’re saying is because there’s a zero in the tens place –",teacher,51,1,1.0,,0.0
"Yeah, it’s closer to the 900 because there’s no tens.",student,10,0,,1.0,
