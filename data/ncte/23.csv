"Good morning, everybody.  Today, we’re beginning our symmetry, and I’m gonna turn this on and ask for volunteers to come up here and explain to me what the lines of symmetry are and why. So, Juan is using the shapes below to learn about symmetry. A says, “Write the letter of the shape that has more than one line of symmetry.”  Could somebody explain to me what a line of symmetry is? Student D?",teacher,74,8,,,1.0
A line of symmetry is like a way that you can pull the shape.,student,14,2,,0.0,
"Good.  So, if you fold the shape, it should look exactly the same on both sides.  Okay.  Can you give me an example of something that’s symmetrical, Student M?",teacher,29,1,1.0,,1.0
A square.,student,2,1,,,
"A square would be symmetrical, because if you folded a square it would look exactly the same on both sides.",teacher,20,3,,,0.0
"Oh, a diamond, ’cause when you fold it.",student,8,0,,1.0,
"Okay.  Good, a diamond.  So, where would a line of symmetry be, Student A?",teacher,14,2,1.0,,1.0
Like if you cut it in half.,student,7,0,,,
"Right.  So, where you fold it or where you cut it in half would be a line of symmetry.  Could things have more than one line of symmetry?",teacher,28,4,1.0,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"How – so, can things have more than two lines of symmetry?",teacher,12,2,,,1.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  So, today, we’re gonna see what we have.  So, Juan is using the shapes below to learn about symmetry.  Write the letter of the shape that has more than one line of symmetry.  Who can come up here and help me?  Student A? Careful of the cord, hon.",teacher,49,3,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Write the letter.  No, it says write the letter of the shape that has more than one line of symmetry. So, he says B.  Can you tell us why?  Could you show us where the lines of symmetry are in B?  Does everyone agree with that?",teacher,46,4,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Does anybody think that there is another shape that has more than one line of symmetry?  Student S, what do you think has more than one line?",teacher,27,3,,,1.0
"Oh, more than one line?",student,5,1,,,
"It says more than one line.  So, we want to underline.  What would we underline and write the letter of the shape that has more than one line of symmetry?  So, let’s underline that.",teacher,34,6,1.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  So, it says, “B draw all the lines of symmetry into the shape you named.”  Are there any more lines of symmetry in this?",teacher,25,4,,,1.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No, good.  Okay.  So, I’m sorry, Student S, you said that there was one.  Was there another one that you found?",teacher,21,0,,,0.0
"Yeah, it’s C.",student,3,0,,,
"So, can you come up here and show us how C would be a line of symmetry.  Thank you, Student A.  How many people agree with Student S?  Okay.  So, you show me where you think it is Student S. Does that look exactly – let’s take a look.  Does this piece look exactly like this piece if we fold it?",teacher,61,2,,,1.0
Yes. No.,student,2,0,,,
How many people think it looks exactly like it?,teacher,9,0,,,1.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"No, I think this piece is gonna be much bigger than this piece when you fold it over.  Okay?  It’s gonna actually go more like this.  Okay.  So, that would not be line of symmetry. Okay.  So, we have B.  How many people got B? Good.  All right. So, draw all – so, now, on the second one.  It says, “The picture below shows one half of a symmetric shape.  The dotted line represents its line of symmetry.  Draw the other half of the shape.”  Student G, you think you can do that?  Would you like to come up and try?",teacher,101,6,,,1.0
Okay.,student,1,0,,,
"Student C, yeah, just get your things and you can go over to [inaudible]. How many people agree with that?  Student G, [inaudible] ’cause, now, I’m gonna have you do one more thing. How many people agree with that?  Okay.  Is there anybody that disagrees with that?",teacher,47,0,,,1.0
Wait.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Can you do me a favor, since you’re up here, can you show me where the lines – if there’s another line of symmetry?  Is there another line of symmetry, do you think? Or is it just that one line of symmetry?  Awesome, that’s great.  Okay.  Everybody agree?",teacher,49,7,,,1.0

"Do you like the – I mean, the ladder on the bottom or –",student,14,0,,0.0,
"You can circle the one that you think is right, and then I’m gonna ask you to find the lines for me.  So, you want one with only one line of symmetry.  Okay.  So, show me the one line of symmetry.  How many people agree with that? Okay.  Did anybody see another line of symmetry in that shape?",teacher,58,8,0.0,,1.0

It’s called an equilateral.,student,4,1,,,
"Equilateral triangle.  So, on a equilateral triangle, look, we’ve got a line that comes this way, you got a line that comes this way and you got a line that comes this way.  So, I wasn’t sure that that is the only one with one line of symmetry.  No, that would not be our answer. Student N, you think you know?  Can you come up here?",teacher,66,9,,,0.0
"Oh, I know.",student,3,0,,,
Is Student N – is it okay – did Student N sign the sheet? Double check that.  Make sure he can be in the –,teacher,25,0,,,0.0
Huh?,student,1,0,,,
"Did you sign this sheet so you can be videoed?  We’ll find out. Okay.  So, if we fold this over this way, it will look the same, right?  Can we fold it any other way?",teacher,35,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No, we can’t so that’s why we – how many lines of symmetry in G?  Can you show us, Student L?  You think there’s more than one in G?",teacher,29,2,,,1.0
There’s more [inaudible] it.,student,4,0,,,
"Okay.  So, I’m sorry, Student N, you’re in the video.  So, you need to be sitting in the back, hon.  Next time, maybe, more people will bring it. Are there any more than that?  So, if it’s a circle –",teacher,40,1,,,0.0
There’s a lot of lines.,student,5,1,,,
"Yeah, there’s a lot of lines.  Look at this.  So, you can keep going, right?  So, there’s many lines of symmetry in a circle.  What about this one?  Is this one symmetrical?",teacher,32,5,1.0,,1.0

Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"Just be at the desk, please, and stay away from that table. It’s broken.  It’s okay.  Just leave it like that, please. Okay.  So, if I fold it, can you see that that wouldn’t be symmetrical?  It would not be the same, ’cause this would come down here.",teacher,48,1,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"All right.  And what about, Student M, since you’re here, what about E?  Do you think E has more than one line of symmetry?",teacher,24,2,,,1.0

That’s what I was drawing.,student,5,0,,,
"Very good, on the diagonal.  Well done. Okay.  So, let’s go back and look at our question one more time.  “Which figure below has only one line of symmetry?” What is it asking?  And which one is my answer?  Student A, what did it ask for?",teacher,46,3,0.0,,0.0

H.,student,1,0,,,
"H, excellent.  Okay, guys.  Please, Student A, can you put this overhead away for me, please? All right.  We’re gonna begin on our math investigations now. Thank you.  Thanks.  You can put that away now.  Now, we’re doing the math now, please. All right, everyone, as soon as you’re seated, I’ll tell you what we’re gonna do today.  Thank you. Thanks.  All right, everybody, so I’m gonna ask you to put your pencils down, sit up in good listening position.  Show me your best attention, ’cause we’re starting something new.  Student D, don’t be distracted, okay? All right, everybody, so, for the next few days, we’re gonna solving multiplication problems that are related to each other.  We’re gonna call these multiplication cluster problems. So, we know what multiplication is.  Oh, wrong, [inaudible] I’m sorry. Cluster problems.  So, if something’s a cluster, it means that they’re clustered together or they’re kind of in a bunch or in a group.  All right?  So, you might have a cluster of grapes.  You might have a cluster of children all huddled together. So, it’s kind of when things are all grouped together.  So, that’s a cluster.  Repeat the word cluster after me.",teacher,198,3,,,0.0
Cluster.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Cluster.  All right.  So, today, I want you to think about this final problem is this is the final problem.  Which one of these would actually help me to solve that?  Just think about it.  Don’t raise your hand until you’re ready, until you know for sure, which one might help you.  Can anybody see anything up there that would actually help them to solve 13 times 8?  Student K?",teacher,70,0,,,1.0
13 times 4.,student,3,0,,,
Why would 13 times 4 help you?,teacher,7,0,,,1.0
"Because, maybe, people don’t know 13 times 8, because of such high numbers, ’cause they could solve like the product of like a huge number.",student,25,1,,1.0,
"Okay.  So, what’s the relationship between 13 times 4 and 13 times 8?",teacher,13,0,1.0,,0.0
Because 13 times 4 is half of 13 times 8.,student,10,0,,1.0,
"Excellent.  This is half of this.  So, in order to find the answer, we do this and then we do what to it?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,0.0
4 times – You would double it.,student,7,0,,,
"Shh.  You double it, right.  Okay.  So, let’s do it.  How do we break down 13 times 4?  Let’s try it.  Student D?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,0.0
You break the 13 into 10 –,student,7,0,,,

"52.  So, my answer to 13 times 4 is 52.  Is that my answer everyone?",teacher,15,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Student D, is that my answer?  What do I need to do to make it 13 times 8?  How does it help me? What do I need to do with that, Student D?  If this is half of this –",teacher,40,0,,,1.0
You have to double it.,student,5,0,,,
"You have to double it.  So, then we have relationships between half and double.  So, if we double this, how do we go about doubling 52?  Student A?",teacher,28,0,1.0,,0.0
104.,student,1,0,,,
"104.  So, you’re saying 2 times 52, 52 plus 52 is 104. Excellent, good. All right.  What other one might help you?  Is there anything else that might help you in figuring out this final problem?  So, we saw the relationship with 13 times 4.  Who has one that they think will help them?  Everybody learns in different ways, so there’s no right or wrong answer here.  It can help you.  Student A?",teacher,73,0,,,1.0
13 times 2.,student,3,0,,,

"If it goes what [inaudible] that you can all – like, if 13 times 2 was a product, I know I can add 4 more.",student,25,2,,1.0,
"Okay.  So, 13 times 2 are your factors, not your product.  What is the product of 13 times 2?",teacher,19,3,1.0,,1.0
The answer.,student,2,0,,,
"Right, the answer.  So, how would I do that?  Can you multiply 13 times 2 or do we need to break it down?",teacher,23,1,,,1.0
You can break it down.,student,5,0,,,
Okay.  How would you like to break it down?,teacher,9,0,1.0,,1.0

You can do –,student,4,0,,,
What’s the relationship between these two numbers?,teacher,7,0,,,1.0

"Think about that.  So, then, you’re saying 6 times 2 is 8?",teacher,12,0,,,0.0
"No, no.  8, 8.",student,4,0,,,
"So, 8 times 2 is 8?",teacher,6,0,,,1.0
"No, 4 times – 4 times 2 equals –",student,9,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  4 times 2.  So, this is one-fourth of this or I would have to multiply this answer by how many to get to that answer?",teacher,26,1,1.0,,0.0

"4, excellent.  So, now, I take the 26 –",teacher,9,0,,,0.0
What is it times 4.,student,5,0,,,

"Is 8.  And then, what do I do next?",teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Teacher?,student,1,0,,,
"I’m sorry, put your hand up, so I can hear, honey.  So, if 4 times 2 is 8, what is 4 times 20?  Remember when we did our 10’s, we saw the relationship between 2, 20, 200, 2,000. What was that relationship?  Student G, can you help her?",teacher,48,0,,,0.0
Add the zeros.,student,3,1,,,

So, whatever way you have to get there, it works.  So, now, we’ve done that. Is there something else that would help you?  Student S? Okay.  Think about it.

No.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay.  So, but if you don’t know your 12s, maybe, that’s not the best thing for you to do.  Maybe, you would have been better off with your 4s.  All right?  So, that’s a 96. What else do I have to do to that?  Student M?  If I’m trying to get to 13 times 8 and I’ve just done 12 times 8, what do I need to add to it to get me up to where I need to be?

So, most people find it easiest, I think, by going 10 times 8, but, in some cases, somebody might decide that this is easier if I say I know 7 times 8 and I know 6 times 8.  Okay?  And that adds up to the same thing. You need to use what’s easier for you.  Or maybe 5, 5 and 3.  So, you use the problems – you use the cluster problems that work for you.  All right? All right, everybody, so today we’re gonna open up to Page 57 and 58.  These are multiplication cluster problems.  Can you take out Pages 57 and 58 from your big book.

"469.  Okay.  So, Student T, tell or somebody tell me what Student T did.  He started with 58 times 3, why did he do that?  Student A?  If he’s looking for 58 times 6, why would he start with 58 times 3?  Student K?",teacher,44,0,,,1.0
Because 58 times 3 is half of 58 times 6.,student,10,0,,1.0,

"174.  So, we had a little math error.  Your process was right, but your math was off.  So, this is equal is 174, right? So, now, why did you end up multiplying this number, your total, which should be 174 times 2, Student T?  Why did you do that?",teacher,49,2,,,1.0
Because I would need the half and half to build the other half.,student,13,0,,1.0,
"Oh, so we have half on one side and then we had to double it again.  Okay.  So, if we find half of 58 times 6, half of 58 times 6, we know that we have to double that answer to get to the actual 58 times 6.  All right?  He found 58 times 3 and what he’s really doing is saying 58 times 3 plus 58 times 3.  Okay?  So, he would do this. He would say 2 times 174.  How does he break that down? Can you figure that out?  Anybody figure that one out for him?",teacher,99,0,1.0,,1.0

Add it.,student,2,1,,,
"Right, ’cause then I’m adding this, everybody, 170 and 4 to get me to 8, 4, 348.  Okay? So, he used half and then doubled it.  That was easier for him.  It may not be easier for other people.  A lot of people like Student G, I know myself, I use 10s, ’cause that’s easier for me.  Okay?  But everybody has their own way of doing it.
