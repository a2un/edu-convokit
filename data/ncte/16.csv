"Okay, good morning.",teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Good morning.,multiple students,2,0,,,
So we’re gonna get started on our multiplication today.  So we have two ultimate goals.   The first goal is to use the words “factor” and “multiple” correctly.  So we have our assessment on Friday.  We started the unit like this.  So who can raise their hand and identify what the factor is and what the multiple is?  And I’ll help everybody out. Student E?  Nice and loud.,teacher,67,4,,,0.0
A factor is – a factor is the two numbers that should go into a product.,student,16,1,,0.0,
"So, when I’m looking here, the factors are 47 and 3.  Okay? Yup.  And who can identify what a multiple is?  Student J?",teacher,23,2,1.0,,0.0
"A multiple is like skip counting.  If you skip counting by 8’s, it would 8, 16, and 24.",student,18,1,,1.0,
"So, if you’re skip counting by 8’s, it would be 8, 16, 24. Alright.  What is the major multiple we’ve been talking about during this unit of study that I want everybody to be able to find at all times?  Which multiple, the first?",teacher,44,3,1.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
No.  Second?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Which one?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
The tenth multiple.,student,3,2,,,
The tenth multiple.  So if you take a look at these strategies that we talked about yesterday – Student J?,teacher,20,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"I put up here the tenth multiple in pink.  So when we talked about breaking up numbers in other ways, one of you – I can’t remember who – you took 47 and you broke it up by finding the tenth multiple, the tenth multiple, the tenth multiple, the tenth multiple and then the seventh multiple. Okay?  And that’s one way to break up numbers.  So anytime you feel lost in multiplication, go into that number and picture the day we did multiple towers.  We were skip counting.   What’s the first multiple of 47?",teacher,94,14,,,0.0
47.,student,1,0,,,
What’s the next multiple?  Student [T]?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
Like 94.,student,2,0,,,
94?  Does anyone agree with that?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
How did you get 94?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
I don't know.,student,3,0,,,
I see Student J trying to figure out if it is 94.  Do you agree?,teacher,15,0,,,1.0
It is.,student,2,0,,,
"Student [N], what do you think it is?",teacher,8,0,,,1.0
150.,student,1,0,,,
"150?  Let me ask you this.  If we can find the tenth multiple, does it matter what the second multiple is?",teacher,21,3,,,1.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  And that’s why we do the tenth multiple.  Because when we have these larger numbers, it gets really tricky to skip count.  It’s easier when the multiples are multiples of 8. Can I hear you say your multiples of 8? to elevate and multiple by 8. Now, if we tried that for 47’s, we don’t have to do it because we wouldn’t be that good.  Okay? So we find the tenth multiple of 47; then that works for us.  Now here, are we finding the tenth multiple of 47?",teacher,90,10,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Mm mm.  What are we trying to do here?  ‘Cause this was the confusion yesterday when you see 10.  What are we finding over here?  What are we really skip counting by here? Student [A]?,teacher,35,0,,,0.0
10; no 3.,student,3,0,,,
"We’re really skip counting by 3’s, okay?  So when you, when you break up this 47, what you’re doing here is you’re finding the tenth multiple of 3.  Now does anybody in here know the tenth multiple of 3?",teacher,39,4,,,1.0
30.,student,1,0,,,
"30, okay? So, in this situation, we’re finding – we’re thinking about 3, the factor 3; that’s the one we want to skip count by.  So this is the tenth multiple of 3.  This is the tenth multiple of 3; the tenth multiple of 3; the tenth multiple of 3, and the what multiple?",teacher,54,9,,,0.0
Seventh.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"The seventh multiple of 3.  Okay?  So, when you’re thinking about those numbers, in this situation I only have three groups of 47, okay?  And so in third grade we talked about thinking about these groups of numbers, okay?  In 47; but I think before you started this unit, I might have seen a lot of people take this equation and do this and add them up. Okay?  And I don’t see that now which I’m very happy about. So today, as you go into your multiplication work, one of the ways you might think it is to break up one of the numbers, one of the factors, okay? Now here’s another way somebody shared yesterday to break up 47.  Do you agree that 47 is a 20 plus a 20 plus a 7?",teacher,134,6,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Yeah.  And what is 20 times 3 and how did you do it?  Hands. What is 20 times 3 and how did you do it? Student N?,teacher,27,0,,,1.0
It’s 60.,student,2,0,,,
It’s 60.  And how did you get that?,teacher,8,0,,,1.0
Because I know 2 – 2 times 3 is 6 and all you have to do is add a zero and you have 60.,student,24,1,,1.0,
Okay.  Can somebody else explain what 20 times 3 is and how they got it?  Student J?,teacher,17,0,0.0,,1.0
"‘Cause if zero times 3 is zero times, zero down and then like times; 2 times 3 and then that would be 6.",student,23,0,,1.0,
"Okay.  Another way.  Can somebody else explain how they got, they can do 20 times 3?  Thinking about the work we’ve done around making it 10 times bigger and try to use that as your explanation in explaining it to us.  Student G.  Nice and clear.",teacher,46,0,0.0,,1.0
I know because 10 times 3 is 30 and 20 is a double of 10 and that would – and if you do 30 plus 30 it would be 60.,student,30,0,,1.0,
So she’s actually breaking up the 20 in her mind into 10 times 3 plus 10 times 3.  Okay?  And 30 plus 30 is the 60.  Now who knows how to do what Student N said – 2 times 3 equals 6?  And Student N said we add a zero.  But is 6 plus zero 60?,teacher,56,1,1.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
No.  What is that language that I want us using?  Student [E]?,teacher,12,0,,,0.0
2 times 3 equals 6.,student,5,0,,,
Yeah.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
6 times 10 equals 60.,student,5,0,,,
"Okay.  So we’re making this 6 ten times bigger.  We made the 2 ten times bigger here.  So our answer we also want to be ten times bigger. Okay.  We picture that small array – I’ll draw it on the board.   We picture the 2 by 3 being a 6 and then, when we’re making it 10 times bigger, instead of a 2, we’re turning it into a 20.  So we’ve done this 6 ten times.  The 3 hadn’t changed. That factor stayed the same – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  So the 3 hadn’t changed, but we did the number 2, 2 rows, 10 times.  So can you count by 2’s for a minute? So now we had stretched it out to 20 rows, okay?  And as Student [E] had said, 6 times 10 is 60.  And I’ve got ten 6’s here.  Alright.  So it’s okay to understand what Student N was saying because that’s how we come into this. We see it like that.  We’re putting a zero here.  But, as far as the math that goes into that, remember that we’re stretching out this number 10 times.  Alright. So one of the strategies you can use today is breaking up the number in any way.  Another strategy is breaking up the numbers by place.  Student J, your eyes should be up here please.  So why did I say breaking it up by place when you look at this?  How do you know that’s by place?",teacher,253,1,1.0,,0.0
How do you know it’s by place?,student,7,0,,,
How do you – so the – one of the strategies we talked about was thinking about the place that the number belongs in and we said we could break a number up that way.  I see two hands and I should see all. I’m trying to have that there but clearly it wasn’t working out. [I’m trying to see if there are] new hands.  Nice and loud.,teacher,68,0,1.0,,0.0
Like you put the 4 in the 40’s place and put the 7 in the 1’s place.,student,17,0,,0.0,
So the 4 in the 40’s place?,teacher,7,0,1.0,,1.0
In the 10’s place.,student,4,0,,,
"Good, in the 10’s place.  So the 4 is in the 10’s place, alright, and it becomes 40.  The 7 is in the 1’s place and it’s just a 7.  So if I picture this number – 3 by 47 seems much bigger than 3 – and so if I’m counting, I’m counting over 40 and there’s my 7; so 47.  So this is 40 what? Columns or rows?",teacher,69,0,,,0.0
Rows.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Rows.  Is that true?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
What do rows look like?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
Columns.,multiple students,1,0,,,
What do rows look like?  Do they come down?,teacher,9,0,,,1.0
"Yeah, coming down.",student,3,0,,,
"I heard over here the right word.  So these are your columns, okay?  So there’s 40 columns and there’s 7 columns and there’s still gonna be 3 rows.  But if I had to put on my other lines, I would have 40 in them.  So that’s what it means to break it up by place.  The 1’s place, the 10’s place and then, later in the year, we’ll move into the 100’s place with multiplication. Alright.  And it’s easier again to solve this.  What is 4 times 3? Everybody.",teacher,89,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,multiple students,1,0,,,
4 times 3.,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
12.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, let’s try this again.  What is 4 times 3?",teacher,10,0,,,0.0
12.,multiple students,1,0,,,
And what do I put?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Zero.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Who could raise their hand and tell me why I put the zero there?  What number did I do? Student A?,teacher,21,0,,,0.0
You’re stretching it out to make it 10 times bigger.,student,10,0,,0.0,
"Good, I’m stretching out the number 12, 10 times bigger.  Okay? So 12 times 10 is that 120.  And then I can easily do 7 times 3; 21.",teacher,28,0,1.0,,0.0
21.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay?  And then the final way – I think Student J might have been the only one that explored this and I explored it a little bit.  But this is that strategy that, if you’re really feeling comfortable breaking up numbers, this is one to look for.  I know that I watched Student J and she does look at numbers.  Student J, your head should be up please. I know Student J looks at numbers and she finds the double a lot.  And that’s one of the strategies that she uses to break up numbers.  And, in this situation, we were able to find the double of 30 and what of 16?",teacher,112,0,,,0.0
The half.,student,2,0,,,
"The half of 16.  So, when you’re finding the double of one, and finding the half of another – can I do that for half?  16 divided by 2?  Yes, I can.  Can I do 30 times 2 to find the double?",teacher,42,1,,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Yes.  Okay? So when I’m finding the double of one and the half of another, it’s gonna be an equivalent expression.  So those mean that they’re what?  What does it mean if they’re equivalent? What’s that word?  They’re equal.  Okay?  So, in this case, who thinks it’s easier to do 6 times 8 and make it 10 times bigger than to do 30 times 16?  Just a show of hands.  If this was your problem, you’d rather solve it than this. That’s why you raise your hand.  Raise your hand if you’d rather solve 60 times 8 than 30 times 16.  Who would rather solve 60 times 8?  Not you Student M?  You like the challenge of 30 times 16?",teacher,120,2,,,0.0
Mm mm.,student,2,0,,,
"No.  6 times 8, you know your facts.  You know 6 times 8 equals –",teacher,15,0,,,0.0
48.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"48.  And then you just make it 10 times bigger.  So Mrs. L likes this strategy – and I do recommend giving it a shot when you see your numbers today, okay? So our work – that’s our first goal: identifying factors and multiples.  We’re gonna be solving our multiplication problems by decomposing one factor, so breaking up one number – decomposing it – or trying the doubling and halving.  I don’t care which strategy you use, but you need to end this unit of study with one solid strategy. When you finish it, it’s gonna be on page 61.  There’s three word problems, okay?  And you’re gonna begin by thinking about our problem solving and plan on making sense of the problem.  I’ll pass out highlighters if you need them. The second is two choices: of the array games – and I’ll pass out your answer sheets for your array games.  You can either do missing factors, thinking about the relationship between multiplication and division, and this chart is here from when we started it awhile ago.  The other one is small array, large array; small array, bigger – yeah; small.  I don’t know why I mess up that name.  Student T reminded us of this game yesterday thinking about a way to record your equations. Does anybody have any questions on what their job is right now? Okay.  I can’t wait to see how you solve the problems on page 61.  Go ahead and get started.  I will come by with highlighters and the sheets. Yeah.

Your name and date should be on your sheet. So, over here, this is a yardstick, Student E, okay?  In a yardstick there are 36 inches.  And that’s what this problem is telling you.  This is – when they talk about a yard, this is what they mean.  Okay?  And this question says how many inches are in 8 yards?  So many inches are in this year? What did I tell you?

We started our conversation thinking about multiplication strategies from yesterday.  Once you get your equation, remember that one that worked really well yesterday was this one for you. Break the numbers by place value.  Okay?  So once you get started and write your equation – Student S, I want to remind you; this is the strategy Student S that worked really well for you yesterday; finding the place of each number and keeping your other factor the same.

But do I have the right answer?,student,7,0,,,
"Yes, and you have the right answer.  So let me see what you did.  So, 8 times 10, 8 times 3.  So this is good.  8 times 10 – so you’re really breaking up the 36 – 10, 20, 30 and 6.   Now your other factor has to stay the same.  So this has to stay an 8.  Okay?  But 8 times 6 is right.  And then you’re ready and you can add all that and you’ll have your answer.  Perfect.  Alright.  Move onto number two. Yeah, that’s an interesting fact on number two.  Very nice.  So you can decide what strategy you want to do for that 36.  Do you want to break it in place value with the 30 and then a 6?  Did you write that yesterday?  What did you do yesterday?  Let’s see. So yesterday you took 16 and you broke it – sorry, I was just checking if the mike was on.  Yesterday, you took 16 and broke it into a 10 and a 6.  Okay?  And then you kept 4 the same; you didn’t change that factor.  So today, can you break up 36 and keep 8 as the same.  Yeah. Please work with your partners.  Remember – Student K – so help her out too.  I don't know – she’s just learning right?  She’s only been here two days.  We don’t know if she had this multiplication at her other school. Okay.

Okay, so now you’re ready to put those.  Now, remember which factor stays the same in your both equations.  So you have your 30.  Good.  Okay.

I did 10 times 5 and then 10 times 5 and then I did 4 times 5 and 4 times 5.,student,21,0,,0.0,
"Okay.  So it seems to me, because you didn’t double anything and half anything, that you really were doing this strategy of breaking up the numbers in another way.  Okay? If you look at this, what did Student [A] tell us the half of 28 was ‘cause she started to do some of this work.  Student M, what did she say?",teacher,61,0,0.0,,1.0
[Inaudible].  Wait.,student,2,0,,,
"She already got us started on the doubles.  What did she say? Student C, what did she say?",teacher,18,0,,,1.0
She took 70 and 70 and doubled it and made 140.,student,11,0,,0.0,
"So she took her answer as 70 and 70 equaling 140; that was a double.  But even before she did that, there was another double she already had seen.  Student N, what was it? Thanks Student C.",teacher,37,0,1.0,,0.0
She broke the 28 into 14 and then she [inaudible].,student,10,0,,0.0,
"Okay, but what did she find the double of?",teacher,9,0,1.0,,0.0
28.,student,1,0,,,
"28.  So she said that 28, its half is a 14.  So she cuts this side in half.",teacher,18,0,,,0.0
Oh!,student,1,0,,,
"What would she do to the 5?  If she cuts one side in half, what does she do to the other side?",teacher,22,0,,,1.0
She cut it to 10.  She –,student,7,0,,,
"What could she now do to try this strategy?  If she cuts this side in half, on the other side she can –?",teacher,23,0,1.0,,0.0
Add another 14?,student,3,1,,,
No.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
Add another –?,teacher,3,1,,,0.0
5.,student,1,0,,,
"5.  So, if she does half of one factor – Student D – then she doubles the other factor.  So what is the double of 5?",teacher,26,0,,,0.0
10.,student,1,0,,,
10.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
So 14 times 10 equals 140.,student,6,0,,,
So 14 times 10 equals –?,teacher,6,0,1.0,,0.0

"140.  So these are two equivalent equations right here, right? So this is that strategy that’s out there.  Before I think I worded it wrong.  I said what’s the double of 28.  The double of 28 is 56.  That didn’t make any sense.  But I’m glad I got the right answer.  “What’s the half I should have said of 28.  Okay?",teacher,61,2,,,0.0
That’s 14.,student,2,0,,,
"That’s 14.  So, when you’re working on your homework tonight, on your multiplication problems, use a strategy that works for you, but try it a second way and just give this one a shot and see if you can find the double of one factor and the half of another and it will equal the same answer and it will be easier for you to solve.  Okay? Alright, please put math binders away.  It’s time to get ready for reading.  We’ll take it out after.  I’m not sure if I want it in this unit or some other review sheet.",teacher,100,2,,,0.0
