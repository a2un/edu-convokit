Good morning Mr. [Inaudible].,multiple students,4,0,,,
"This morning we are going to continue with [inaudible] 7, moving between solids and silhouettes.  And we are going to be doing session 2.1, “Silhouettes of Geometric Solids.” Today you should be able to analyze the silhouettes of 3D solids and also be able to match solids and silhouettes. Last time we did, again, was the shape, and we were able to explore the attributes of three-dimensional solids.  We talked about [faces] being a point on the solid where two or more edges meet.  And when two faces meet together, we say that this is an edge.  And we also identified that the 3D solids are made up of 2D faces.  We noted that some of the faces were squares; some of their faces were triangles. So today we are going to continue by looking at the silhouettes.  Anybody here knows anything about silhouettes? Yes?",teacher,145,5,,,0.0
It’s like a shadow of the shape but you only see one side.,student,13,0,,1.0,
"Thank you! It is exactly a shadow, the shadow of the shape. How many have known about this word before?  Oh good, good. So today we are going to learn something new, and then you can go home and share with your parents.  [Inaudible] Silhouettes are the black shadows or shapes produced when an object lost light.  Now when the sun’s rays are out there and you are walking, what do you see on the ground?",teacher,76,0,1.0,,0.0
Your shadow.,student,2,0,,,
"Your shadow.  Have you ever asked yourself why you are seeing your shadow?   It looks kind of crooked, right? But it’s dark solid.  It is dark because your body is a solid mass. Light cannot penetrate through you.  So the light is reflected and your shadow is thrown on the ground.  The length of your shadow will depend on the time of the day. So likewise this morning we’re going to be looking at the images, the silhouettes that we produce when we put our three-dimensional solids on this projector so that you can be blocking the light from the – the mirror here will reflect the light coming from the projector so that the shadow or the silhouette of our shape will be projected on the screen. Watch what happens when I put my hand.  Do you see the outline of my hand?  But you cannot see my veins, you cannot see anything, you just see the shadow of my hand.  What is causing this is because the light from this cannot penetrate through my hand, so it bounces on this mirror and is reflected away, and that’s why it casts that shadow.  So that is what we call silhouettes.  Any question about silhouettes and what it means? So we’re going to be looking at shadows.  If you don’t remember the word silhouette, remember that a silhouette is a shadow produced when any solid object lost light.  The solid object cannot absorb the light so the light is reflected away from that surface, and then you see the black shadow. So, I’m going to pull out the first geometric solid, and then we’ll have to identify the name like we did last time.  What is the name of this solid?  Student J?",teacher,293,6,,,0.0
A cube.,student,2,1,,,
A cube.  How many faces does a cube have?,teacher,9,2,,,1.0
Six.,student,1,0,,,
"Six faces.  Okay.  So this is our cube.  When I put this cube on the projector, what do you think the image or the silhouette will look like, the shadow that is going to pass on the screen?  What do you think will be the shape? Yes?",teacher,47,2,,,0.0
Square.,student,1,1,,,
She said a square.  Anybody else have a different idea? Yes?,teacher,11,1,,,1.0
A 2D square.,student,3,1,,,
"A 2D square.  Okay, let’s try it.  Did it produce a square?",teacher,12,2,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Do we see the whole figure?,teacher,6,1,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"We don’t see the whole figure.  This is the side that is facing the light, so that’s the side that we see.  Now, when I put it like this, what happens? When I put it to rest on this edge.  It produces a little bit to show you that something – that this thing does not just have – you can see the corners, right? But it cannot be seen as the 3D.  It always shows the 2D.  Now when I put it on its edge, what shape does it produce?",teacher,91,1,,,0.0
A rectangle.,student,2,1,,,
"A rectangle.  If I limit the [inaudible] to one of the faces, it produces what?",teacher,15,1,,,0.0
A square.,multiple students,2,1,,,
"Okay.  Now, like the silhouettes.  Let me try another one.",teacher,10,0,,,0.0
"Mr. [Inaudible], why does it turn into a rectangle when it sits on the edge?",student,15,1,,0.0,
"When it sits on the edge it’s projected, so you see part of this side and part of that side on the light.  The light is reflected on part of this side and part of that side.  So if [inaudible] a straight line, it forms a rectangle.  It forms a rectangle.  Okay, let’s think about this one.  So we said that this would produce square silhouettes.  I want everybody to say the word silhouettes.  Say silhouettes.",teacher,76,4,1.0,,0.0
Silhouettes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Now you see that it has an “h” like in house, okay?  It’s hard to spell.  But if you think about the letter that makes the sound you hear, that’s a French word.  So the “h” is silent.  Okay? When you are singing the song, “Alouette,” is sort of like “silhouette”.  The “h” is silent, but you want to be able to spell it correctly.   It’s sil-hou-ette. Sil-hou-ette.  Then you’ll be able to spell it correctly. But it’s pronounced silhouette. Now what do you think this cone, what kind of silhouette do you think it’s going to produce? Yes.  A circle from which side? You think it’s going to produce the same silhouette when I put it on the circular face and when I put it on the face, are they going to be the same silhouette?",teacher,137,2,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So what would produce a circle?  This one? When I let it to rest on the circular face.  So let’s try it.,teacher,22,1,,,0.0
That would be a circle.,student,5,1,,,
Circular face to produce the circle.  Do you see the top?,teacher,11,1,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"Why? Why we don’t see the top? Yes, Student D?",teacher,10,0,,,0.0
If you stand it up straight then you get – because you can’t see the [inaudible] but if you stand it up straight you can’t see the top of the [inaudible].,student,31,0,,1.0,
"This is the side that is blocking the light.  The circular base, the base is the side that is blocking the light, so that is the image we see.  What kind of shape do you think is going to produce when I let it light up on its curved face?",teacher,50,0,1.0,,0.0
A triangle.,student,2,1,,,
Who said a triangle? Yes.,teacher,5,1,,,0.0
A cone?,student,2,0,,,
"A cone? It’s going to show a cone?  How many [think] it’s going to be a triangle when it’s projected? How many [think] it’s going to be a cone? All right, let’s try this.  Triangle. Now who knows why this is a triangle? Yes?",teacher,44,3,,,0.0
Because it’s shaped like a triangle on the side.,student,9,1,,1.0,
"So the side that is blocking the light is shaped like a triangle.  You have to trace this line.  You trace it like this.  It’s going to be triangular, right? Okay, remember, this is producing two-dimensional silhouettes.  Is it called two-dimensional?  When we were doing our 2D, when we did our polygon, what we call that is a polygon?",teacher,59,6,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Why would this not be a polygon? Student F?,teacher,9,1,,,1.0
A polygon has to be four sides.,student,7,1,,,

It can’t be a …,student,5,0,,,
Would this be considered a polygon?,teacher,6,1,0.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So why is it not a polygon? Student V, I called you.",teacher,12,1,,,0.0
I can’t be a polygon because it has no straight sides.,student,11,1,,0.0,
"It doesn’t have straight sides.  Yes, what else?",teacher,8,0,1.0,,1.0
"Because it has a curve, and a polygon has more than only one side.",student,14,1,,1.0,
This one has a curved edge.  Polygons cannot be curved.  The side or the line segment has to be straight.  Now Student F said that polygons are only four sides.  Is a hexagon a polygon?,teacher,35,5,1.0,,0.0

I was thinking about a quadrilateral.,student,6,1,,,
"All right, you were thinking about a quadrilateral, thank you. All right, so, when you rest a cone on its side it projects a triangle silhouette.  When you rest it on its base, it projects a circular silhouette.  Yes, Student W?",teacher,41,2,1.0,,0.0

Circle.,multiple students,1,1,,,
"This is a circle, the same thing.  See that?  Because this is the point.  It’s a circle.  You see that?  And we are seeing mostly this surface, because that’s the face that’s very big, so we see the reflection of that face.  Do you see that? Okay, so, what we are going to do now.  Everybody have your question? Let me now give the assignment.  This is what we’re going to do.  You’re going to work with your partner in your small group.  You work with the person sitting on the same side of the desk as you.  Your job will be to look at the solids in this bag, pull out one solid at a time.  You and your partner will use Student Activity Book page 5.  You’re going to match the silhouettes and the solids.  So you look at each silhouette on page 5 and then identify the solids that you think would produce those silhouettes.  Now, the solids are all numbered.  Can I finish talking? The solids are all numbered, 1 – 12.  You can have any of those that are in your bag.  Each bag contains six of the solids. When you’re finished we’re going to swap.  The bags are also numbered.  3A and 3B will go together.  So when you’re finished, if your group is working with 3A or 3B, when you are done, you raise your hand, and we’re going to swap bags with those who are using 3A.  In that way you’re able to do all 12 solids.   Now when you identify these, you match the solid and the silhouettes, write down the number that you find on the solid block.  Write it on the silhouettes on page 5. I’m going to repeat myself. When you go back to your seats you’re going to work with your partner that is sitting next to you on the same side of the desk. You’re going to have one of these bags.  You will work with your partner to identify and to match the solids and their silhouettes.  The solids are all numbered.  When you identify a silhouette that this solid can produce.  The letter number on this is one, so when you find the silhouette that will be produced by this cube, you’re going to write this number one on that silhouette. Now, I’m going to say one thing.  Some of these solids can produce more than one silhouette.  We just noticed that the cone can produce how many silhouettes? How many?",teacher,417,3,,,0.0

Triangle.,multiple students,1,1,,,
"Triangle, okay.  So when you find those ones you are going to put the number of the solid on the silhouette.  If you and your partner are not sure, if your partner says, “Oh, I think this one is going to produce this, I don’t know,” take that solid, come to the overhead, put it, to confirm, and then you and your partner will go back and write it down. When you are done with the solids, you and your partner are going to write down in your [inaudible] which one was the most difficult to identify the silhouette.  Which one was most surprising for you, all right? And then we’ll come back to check.  Any questions.  Student V?",teacher,119,1,,,0.0
"If you [inaudible] and you put it on the edge, will it look like a square?",student,16,1,,0.0,
"I don’t know, that’s what you’re going to find out.  You have to find that out.  You’re going to match the solids and their silhouettes.  Anyone that has confusion, if you and your partner are arguing about if it’s true or not, you come up to the overhead with your partner.  Put the solid on the overhead and then see the silhouette that is projected, then you will match it.  I do not want people rushing to the overhead.  You must try to identify it first.  When you don’t agree, that is when the two of you will come.  I’m going to control how it’s done so that you will not do your work and everybody is rushing to the projector.  We have to do it in a nice manner.  If there are some of the silhouettes that don’t have a matching solid.  You write none on that silhouette.  Any questions? Can somebody tell us what you are going to do when you return to your seat.  Yes, Student R, tell the class what you will do.  Remind us. Speak up.",teacher,181,0,1.0,,0.0

"Right or wrong, good.  What else are you supposed to do?",teacher,11,0,1.0,,1.0
You’re supposed to write the number on the shape.,student,9,0,,0.0,
"Thank you.  You have to write the number on the shape, on each matching silhouette, very important.  And what else did I say? Okay, let me remind you again.  Some solids have more than one silhouette.  Find the silhouettes and write that number on that silhouette.  Don’t say, oh we already did one on this, therefore it cannot be.  Any one that you think will produce that silhouette, put that number on that silhouette, so that some silhouettes will have 2, 3 or 4 numbers on it, and if there are some silhouettes will have no matching solid, write “none”.  Are we ready to move?",teacher,105,0,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, if you have table 1, go to your seat.  Table 1 you have this bag.  Table 2, you will have this bag.  [Inaudible] you are going to share it.  Table 3, come to your seats. Table 4, come to your seats.  And then table 5, [inaudible]. You start with the cube.  Find out the silhouette that it can produce and then just put it down. Page 5.  You are doing page 5.  Page 1 has the names of all the geometric solids.   Now when you pull out one from the bag and you find that one, you put it back so that the other table can use it.  You’re not doing it by yourself. Page 5.  Write your name and date. [Lots of noise, students talking together, can’t hear what the teacher is saying any more.  He’s talking to individual students and helping them, too far from the mike.] How are we doing here? Boys and girls, it’s time to exchange bags.  Listen, it’s time to exchange bags.  You must have done the shapes you have in your bag.  Swap bags. Finish up, in the next two minutes you should [inaudible]. Five more minutes. Okay, we’re going to come back to share.  Put the solids in the bag and let’s come back together to share what we found out. Okay, table 1, sit with your partner.  Are you table 1? Table 1, you and your partner make sure the solids are back in the bag. Table 4, put all the solids back in the bag.  Table 2, sit with your partner.  Table 3, bring your paper with you and your notebook.  Table 4 and 5, [inaudible].  Sit down.  You are going to be sharing your findings. Okay, we are going to discuss our findings in the activity matching solids and silhouettes.  Page 5.  What is one thing that you found out? What is one thing you found out by doing this?

Nobody mentioned this.  How about K? How many could find a solid to go with K?  How many people could find a solid for silhouette K?  How many people did not identify … put your hands down, thank you.  How many did not identify any solid for silhouette K?  If your hand did not go up the first time, your hand needs to be up. Okay.

Edge.,student,1,0,,,
"Edge, thank you.  When you rest the cube on its edge, it produces a rectangular silhouette, which is [inaudible]. Do you see that now? So write 1 for K.  So, K is produced by resting it on the edge. So we’re going to add that to our list: Some solids produce a different silhouette when it is resting on its edge.  And we give an example.  Example, the cube.  A cube will produce a square silhouette when resting on a face, but a rectangular silhouette if laid on end of its edge. So that’s good, I’m so happy that people discovered that. Now, in the next one minute, we’re going to review the answers and make sure that everybody got it correctly. Okay. A.  A was produced by which solids?  Now you are checking your page 5.  Page 5.

"We’re looking at number 1, the next one is cylinder [inaudible], the sizes of the square produced are not the same.  So you have also to use the size of the square produced.  Just say which of these would produce that. This one produced a smaller square, so it’s a not-go with that one.  So for C you only have the large cube and the wide cylinder.  [Inaudible] will do that big square. Then D, you have a square, which is number 7.  And also the sphere is number 7.  The sphere, which you called a circle, the sphere is number 10.  You have number 10, the sphere is number 10.  The hemisphere is number 7, and then you also have the wide cylinder.  This one, this one, the wide cylinder.  Are you writing it down?
