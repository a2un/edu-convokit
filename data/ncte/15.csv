And we have a few people that did it here, we have a few people that did it.  The other people did it over there, and we have it out there. And now we’re going to do a little bit extra, extra math.  And you should be able to do – after you build your tower, Student K, after you build your tower, you should be able to write and predict.  So after you predict, you write the multiplication.  You write the multiple.  You write the multiple of 10.",teacher,111,4,0.0,,0.0

That could be a tower too, because we use all these.  But yesterday the best that I learned about you is when we were doing this tower using only two digits, only two digits – she was [inaudible] – only two digits and I find out there are some people – and you know these are going to go up there – I find out there are some people that did an even better wonderful job.  And they keep on asking how many other ways.  And they did other ways.  They use other ways. And now we kind of do other.  Now, I looked at this one and I see that person.

Another person.  Hold this and check to see what she did.  And another person, that was Student M. Student M did the same thing as this.  She wrote her – and her number was 55, the base number. And she kind of used the value of skip counting by 5 and built on it. But she did the same thing.  She wrote down the 4th multiple, the 5th multiple, the 12th multiple, and the 16th multiple, and the 20th multiple.  And I think those people have a very good base.
