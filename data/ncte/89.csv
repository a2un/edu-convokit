"All right, create a class list of addition strategies to add three-digit numbers to three-digit numbers.  We’re going to come up with a couple of different ways that we can add three-digit numbers to three-digit numbers.  And what we’re going to do is we’re going to write them on [chalk] paper and then we’re going to hang them up in the classroom so that you can use them as a reference. Now, is it all right if Student S uses one strategy and Student L uses a different strategy, is that all right?",teacher,93,7,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Sure, as long as you know what your strategy is and how to use it correctly, then it doesn’t matter whether Student L uses a different one than Student S, that’s fine, that’s perfectly fine.  So what we’re going to do today is we’re going to go – well, actually a family is going to go on a road trip.  How many people have ever been on a road trip before? So what’s a road trip all about?

"A car, okay? So how many people have ever driven to New York? Sure, that would be a road trip.  How many have ever driven to New Hampshire? How many of you have ever driven to Connecticut or Rhode Island.  Sure, they’re road trips. This family, so Student J and Student N you can both sit back, that’s good, you guys can’t be on camera.  And Student N, you can come back and sit in your seat. So this family is going to go on a road trip, and we have a map of where they’re going.  So let’s just check out the map of the Jones’s family’s road trip. All right, let’s quiet down please. All right, everybody look at the map.  So we’ve been talking about the regions.  What region is in this map? There’s a couple of regions in this map.  Student G, what’s one of the regions we see in this map?",teacher,156,0,,,0.0

"No, we said Ohio is not in the Southeast, it’s not in the Northeast.  The Midwest.  So this map of the United States – I’m waiting – this map of the Jones’s family trip, actually they end up going to three different regions in the United States, so that’s pretty cool.  So where did they start? Do we know where they started? Where did they start, Student C? Where is there home? What state is that? They started in Ohio, that’s where they’re from, that’s where their home is.  So we’re going to find out how far they drive each week, okay? So we’re going to add up the distances they drive each week to see how far they’ve gone for their whole trip. So what I want you to do, independently, because I want to see what strategy you use to do addition, not what your friend uses sitting next to you, but your own strategy, okay? I want to see what strategy you use.  So there’s not a lot of room on this piece of paper, so if you take out your math notebook, you could use some paper in your math notebook to answer these questions.  But we’re going to read the questions together. Okay, so it says, solve these problems about the Jones’ family’s car trip.  Show your solutions so that someone else can understand how you solved the problem.  So you need to do it nice and neat and accurately so if someone looks at your paper they will be able to tell how you solved the problem, okay? So problem number one, who wants to read that nice and loud for me? Student N, nice and loud? So Student C, you’re not going to be able to hear this if you’re talking. Story problem number one.  Student J, you’re not going to be able to hear the problem if you keep talking, so the two of you need to quiet down please.",teacher,328,5,,,0.0
In the first week of their trip the Jones family drove 427 miles from their home in Ohio to [inaudible] in Kentucky. After their visit there they drove 732 miles to Virginia Beach.  How many miles did they drive altogether?,student,40,0,,0.0,
"All right, I want you to solve that problem.  So it’s going to be nice and quiet because we’re working independently, because I want to see what strategy you use.  Not what strategy that your friend sitting next to you uses, so that’s why we’re not doing it together.  I want to make sure that each of us by the end of the day has at least one good strategy to use for addition.",teacher,74,1,0.0,,0.0

What?,student,1,0,,,
"If you finish the first one, you can go on to problem 2 and problem 3, and when we get back together in a little while we’re going to talk about the different strategies that people used. Now remember, what do we need at the end of our answer?",teacher,49,0,,,0.0

"How many, good, Student K.  How many.  So in the question, after the word “how many,” we’re going to find what our label is going to be. [Students working independently, teacher whispering to various students.] So I see a lot of you guys are using the same strategy. So follow along, when we read the story problem, follow along on the map so you can see where they’re going. If you finish with the first three you can move on to the back. All right, so the back, the first column says “the item that you purchased,” the second column is how much it costs, the third column is how much you gave the person working at the store, and then the last column is, how much money did you get back? So if I want a soda and it costs a dollar, and I gave the person working in the store a five dollar bill, how much money would I get back, Student I? It costs a dollar, I gave them a five-dollar bill? It costs one dollar, I gave him five.  So how many dollars did I spend? I had five dollars, I spent how many dollars? I gave the person five, but how much was my soda?",teacher,210,0,,,0.0
One.,student,1,0,,,
"So I took away one dollar.  So how many dollars was I supposed to get back? Four.  So that’s how you do this sheet.  They want to know in the last column how much money you’re going to get back after you bought that item. It looks like everybody’s on the back, and the back isn’t really what we’re going to talk about today.  We’re more worried about the front today.  So why don’t we stop and turn back over and look at problem number one.  So Student L, can you re- read number one for us, nice and loud so everyone can hear. So Student C can hear us in the back?",teacher,113,0,,,0.0

So, a lot of us did it the same way, so we’re going to have one person come to the board and do it the way most of us did it.  We’re going to have Student C come to the board and show us the way he did it.  And we’re going to have Student K come to the board and show the way.  So Student K and Student C come up.  Student K, you put yours in the middle. And I need – [All students yelling to be called on.] Student [inaudible].  Hmm, I like this one too.  I didn’t see yours. You can go up there and put yours up there too. Wait, you need your piece of paper. [Students all talking to each other while the selected students write theirs on the board.] 5…4….  You guys need to go back to your seats please… 3…2....1.  I’m waiting.  I already counted down from 5 so it should be silent.  When I get to 1 it’s silence, we know that.  Thank you. All right.

And then he kept the 27 and the 33, added those to get 60.  Then he added them to get 1,160. Now, Student L and Student J, theirs look a like and they kind of did the same thing, but they included one more step.  Can someone tell me what the extra step that they included was?

Student L broke out the 100s and then he broke out the 10s place and he had the ones place, so everything was separate, and then he had three answers to get his final answer.

20.  And this three represents?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
30.,student,1,0,,,
"30.  So when we add these up, we’re not getting 6 but we’re getting 60, because a 6 in the tens place means 60.  So then Student M, what did you do?",teacher,32,2,,,1.0
"I added the 400 and the 700 and I got 1,100.  And since there was no place to put the 1000 I dropped it down to [inaudible] and put the 100 [inaudible].",student,32,0,,0.0,

There’s one more way that I didn't see anyone do, and what it is is, you take one of the numbers, okay, and then you add whatever’s in the ones column to it and you get an answer, and then add the tens column of the other number to that answer, and then add the hundreds column.

So I’m going to erase this and I’m going to write a new problem three times, and we’re going to solve this problem three different ways.  And then we’re going to end up with three strategies.  So I’m going to erase this and write a new problem on the board.  So what I want you to do is – I don’t like this new chalk, it doesn’t really erase that well. [Students talking about the chalk, crosstalk] All right, so we’re going to use the problem – I’m waiting for it to quiet down – okay.  586 plus 345.  So go to a clean piece of paper, okay?

"11.  Now, I’m going to put my 1 in the ones column here, and I’m going to put the 1 in the tens column, because this is the tens column.  This 1 goes in the tens column.  It means 5. I’m getting really aggravated.  This is the third time I’ve had to stop because you guys keep talking.  It’s unacceptable. It’s unacceptable, Student L.  Stop banging.  Stop talking to your partner, or we will not be having recess, and we’ll do this during recess time.  You guys have been doing really well.  Don’t lose it in the last five minutes of class please. All right, so when we have 11, this 1 is in the ones column, so we’re keeping it in the ones column.  This one is in the tens column, so we’re going to put it in the tens column.  So let’s add this up.  1 plus 8 is…",teacher,151,1,,,0.0

"13.  It’s really 130.  But if I add zero to this, is it going to change?",teacher,16,1,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"It’s going to stay the same.  So we don’t need to worry about the zero in the ones column.  Because adding zero to something – if you had $100.00 and I gave you zero dollars, are you still going to have $100.00?",teacher,42,0,,,0.0
Yeah.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"I didn’t give you anything.  So this is really 10 plus 80 plus 40, which is really 130.  The zero is going to be in the ones column, but we don’t need that zero because if you add zero it’s not going to do anything.  The 3 is going to be in the tens column, and then we need to carry the 1 over into the hundreds column.  So now let’s add the hundreds column.  100 plus 500 plus 300?",teacher,80,4,,,0.0
900.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So 900 the same thing.  Add zero to the ones column, it’s not going to do anything.  Add zero to the tens column, it’s not going to do anything.  So we just put our 9 in the hundreds column.  Do we end up with the same answer?",teacher,47,3,,,0.0
