I'm going to use my numbers that I have here, and I have a wild card.  I'm going to try as much as I can to make these numbers.  I have 600.  I'm going to use this now to be – 600 to be 0. I'm going to use 8.  That's what I have.  I've used this number, 608 plus – I'm trying to make my number as much – I'm looking at a number that is too close to 1,000.  The cards I have are too big.  I'm going to do everything possible.  I'm going to have 4, 6, 8.  That's the least I can do.  This is 16.  I have taken away the 10.  I'm moving to the tens place.  I have 7, then I have 1,000.  I have 1,000 [inaudible].  My score is going to be – if I take away 1,000 from this, I'm left with 76.  My score is 76. It goes here.",teacher,194,1,0.0,,0.0

If I want to make 1,000, I notice this is 10.  I put my 8 here.  This is 10.  Look here.  What is that?  Can you start adding your numbers and stop looking for trouble?  Stop.  Leave it this way.  Look here.  For example, what is – leave this.  You don't need this.  What is 7 plus 3?  You write a 0, and a 1.  What are you going to add to 6 to make it a 10?  Remember, you have 10 already.  You write 8, 4, 7 plus 2, 5, 3.  Now add it up. Add it here.  8, 4, 7.  Pull out 6.  You're using 6 cards. Allow him to do it the way he wants.  It doesn't matter. This is too much.
