Those are all words that – not all of them we’re going to use today, but as we introduce the unit today, those are all words that you will see over the next couple weeks.  What I’m going to ask you to do now is I’m going to ask you actually tuck your word search into your desk. Okay, as soon as you’re done, eyes up here, please.

"Thank you, sir.  Student J.  Remember, I should only have to say something once and you follow the directions.  Okay. And before we get started, up here is our goal for the day. Remember how in morning meeting usually we set a goal, how we’re going to behave for the day, what we’re going to do to make a good day.  This is our goal for our math lesson today.  Okay?  So at any point I ever say to you, Student M, what are we trying to learn today, it’s up there, so you know what we have to do.  Okay? So in our new unit we’re learning the shape of data, or day- ta.  People say it two different ways.  Raise your hand if you’ve heard it “data.”  Raise your hand if you’ve heard “day-ta.”  Okay.  So everybody’s heard it in a different way.  It means the same thing.  It’s spelled the same way. So what we’re going to have to learn today is you’re going to be able to describe or explain how and why we collect data.  Okay/ And you’re going to be able to explain a line plot.  Raise your hand if you did a line plot in third grade.  You did. Good. It’s a [inaudible] into some graphs, getting us into bar graphs.  It looks like a bar graph but without the bar.  It has the X’s all the way up.  You might be familiar with those.  If not, we’re going to do one today.  You’re actually going to create one with boxes of raisins.  Okay?

"Oatmeal raisin cookies.  So maybe I need to know how many raisins are in a box because I need a certain amount of raisins for my cookies, right?  So it’s always good to have the data so I know how many boxes of raisins I might need. That’s not the case today.  We’re going to find out today what we need to do. All right.  So, the first thing we’re going to do is I’m going to give you a piece of paper towel.  That’s going to go right in front of you in the middle of your desk.  I’m going to give you a box of raisins.  You cannot open your raisins.  You’ll be able to, because I told you yesterday that once we’re done you can eat them if you’d like.  If you don’t like raisins, you’re not forced to eat them. Maybe someone at home likes raisins.  Maybe you want to take them home so they can put them in their oatmeal.  Or maybe you can say, “Can you make me some oatmeal cookies?” and they can make them today. You can’t open them yet.  Does everybody understand that? You will be able to open them but not just yet, because we have to do a little testing, a little experimenting.  Can I actually have two volunteers?  Let’s see, I need two volunteers that are sitting nicely, their desk is clean and organized. Let’s see, Student K, you can come pass out paper towels for me. Actually, Student K, why don’t you do the back three rows for me, and [inaudible] front three groups, and Student K, if you could give Student D one that would be great.

So I’m going to, I could draw on my whiteboard but then I’d have to erase it, right?  And that would be no fun.  What we’re actually going to do is we’re going to use your raisin boxes instead of X’s.

Okay?  Write your first name.  Write on the top left, honey.  Write in there. Raisins smell good, huh?  Okay.  Now before I create a line plot, obviously I have a line and it’s called the line plot because I’m going to plot my data.  I’m going to put it up on there so I can see it, I can see the shape of the data. I have to have a name.  You have to name every single graph, bar graph, pie chart.  Anything that you create, it needs to have a name, so that way you know what your data was that you collected.  I need to know what I’m trying to figure out. Just like when we talk about a word problem, you can’t just put the number.  You have to label it.  Right?  If it’s 37 oranges, you have put the word “oranges.”  I need to know what you’re talking about.  So if someone were to come in and say, “Oh, great line plot.  What’s it collecting? What’s the data it’s all about?”  You have to make sure your title’s up there so people know. So let’s brainstorm.  What do you think the title of my line plot should be?  Average of raisins?  We’re not finding the average yet.  The average is something we can find once we’ve plotted of all our data, Student D, so keep that in mind.  Student D, you’re going to be my average holder.

Student D, you’re going to stick it right above 30.  Good.  And Student T, you’re going to stick it right above his.  Very nice.  So how many do I have in 30? I have two.
