"What we’re going to study is geometric shapes.  And for the next three weeks what we’ll be studying is – we have studied two-dimensional shapes before.  Remember when we did rectangles and we did squares – rectangles, squares, and triangles? Well, today we’re going to do three- dimensional shapes.  We studied some of these in third grade, correct?",teacher,58,8,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay, so this is what we’re about for the next three weeks.  By the end of the three weeks we’ll be able to find volume of these -- how much they’ll hold in terms of volume.  In two- dimensional shapes we found area, remember that?",teacher,45,4,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
So in the three-dimensional shapes we’re going to find volume. So you have several objects on your table.  So this lesson we’re really going to try to find out how we can identify the various three-dimensional shapes.  So I’m going to use steps to accomplish that. What is this?,teacher,49,3,,,1.0
A cone.,multiple students,2,0,,,
"It’s called a cone.  How many faces?  When we talk about three- dimensional shapes, we talk about faces, which is the correct vocabulary.  So how many faces do you see on a cone? One.  What about, what is this?",teacher,39,1,,,1.0

Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"We’re going to look at cylinders.  And we’re going to describe them.  So if you would take out your math workbook, we’re going to work in pairs.  You two are a pair.  If you have someone beside you, work in a pair.  If you don’t, then work by yourself.  You’re going to need your math book. You’re going to go to Unit 7.  And on this page you’re going to guess the solids.  You want to go to page 1. Please take out page 1.  Page 1 should be a page with lots of … everybody needs to do this. So this is a square prism, right? Sorry, a square pyramid rather. What is half of a sphere called?",teacher,119,5,,,0.0
Hemisphere.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Hemisphere, very good.  Good job of remembering third grade. What I would like you to do is take a look at page 1, and with your partner you want to describe each shape.  So here you are with a cube.  How would you describe that if you had to describe it to somebody who had never seen a cube before? How would you describe it? What are the characteristics? What are the components? You want to write it with your partner, so I’ll come around and visit with you.  So you’re describing them. All three-dimensional figures are solids.  Solid meaning they’re not hollow in any way.  Yes?",teacher,107,3,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"You write it beside the figure.  You and your partner decide how would you describe it.  For example, I am going to describe it, I’m going to use these vocabulary words to describe it, because these are the mathematical terms you use when you’re describing any geometric shape, is that clear? So here is your [chance].  What’s a vertex?",teacher,59,2,,,1.0
A corner.,student,2,0,,,

The 20th.,multiple students,2,0,,,
"20th.  So what you want to do is identify the characteristics, at least three characteristics of every shape on your paper.  They’re already named, so you know that’s a cube, the first one, but what are the attributes, what are the characteristics of a cube? Anybody know? Let’s do number one together.  What’s one of the characteristics of a cube? Excuse me? Is that kind of like a cube? Is that like a cube?",teacher,74,6,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So here you are.  This is a cube.  What can you say about a cube?,teacher,15,2,,,1.0
It has six faces.,student,4,0,,,

Eight.,student,1,0,,,
"Eight.  What else can you say about it? Is there anything special about the faces, the six faces? Are they six equal faces?",teacher,23,0,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Yes, they’re equal.  All the sides are equal.  Eight vertices. What else can you say about a cube?",teacher,18,1,,,1.0
12 edges.,student,2,0,,,
And it has 12 edges.  So edges is another word.  Do you understand what to do?  Is everybody clear on what to do with each of the figures we have?,teacher,30,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Okay.  So I’ll just come around and look at what you have.  So what about a rectangular prism when you get to that?,teacher,23,2,,,1.0
Six. Six faces.,student,3,0,,,
"Do you want to work with… I guess you don’t have the space.  Do you want to turn your table around? Is there anybody not comfortable working by themselves right now? You should pick up each as many as you have… And also your faces, right? Faces, edges, is it a prism, is it a cylinder? [Inaudible] the back sides also.  So here is one, two, three, four. These have four sides.  Have you ever put a box together? Yeah.  Once you put it together, then you have a back side, front side, two sides, bottom side, top side. What do you notice about the shape? They’re rectangular.  Are all sides equal?",teacher,112,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"[Inaudible]. What kind of angles are they? Can you be more specific? What kind of angles are they? [Inaudible] Remember you’re trying to describe these.  So if you are looking at something with a cylindrical body like this, you want to say two faces…  Hello.  You want to say two faces and cylindrical body.  Cylinder means the roundness, it’s like a cylinder.  Think about trying to describe this for a child who has never seen these shapes before. There we go, very good. This has how many edges? Four edges, right.  [Inaudible] Some shapes we have to share, guys.  You may have to share your … just a second, yes?",teacher,110,2,,,0.0
Do you have a cone?,student,5,0,,,

Rectangles.,student,1,1,,,
"All right, we’re going to come back together as a group and we’re going to have people from each group describe a shape.  Do you understand that? So that all of us can see if we got all the attributes down. All right, have we completed these six so far?",teacher,50,1,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Have we completed six of them so far?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So let’s stop for a minute and I’m just going to go in order of how we’re seated.  The octagonal prism will be you two. The rectangular prism is going to be you two.  And the cylinder is going to be Student F and M.  All right? So let’s start.  Do you have an example of the shape? Very good. We all should be listening.  Pencils down.,teacher,67,4,,,0.0
The cube has six faces.  [Inaudible].,student,6,1,,,

It’s not hollow.,student,3,0,,,
It’s not hollow.  Is this hollow?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So it is solid.  If it’s not hollow it’s solid, right? And it’s because it’s a solid, we can find out how much volume it will hold.  Remember when we did area with three- dimensional shapes? We could find out how much it would cover, how much carpet we’d need to do this room.  Well, with a three-dimension shape the measurement that you find is not area but volume, do you understand? Does that make sense?",teacher,76,7,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So with two-dimensional shapes we find area.  With three- dimensional shapes we find a different measure, which is called volume.  So as long as you don’t get those mixed up, all right? Next group.  Thanks, Student E.  Next group.",teacher,39,5,,,0.0

No.,student,1,0,,,
"But it’s helpful for us to describe it.  It’s solid and it’s cylindrical in shape.  Student J, cylindrical in shape, okay? So it’s cylindrical in shape.  All right.  Anybody have any questions about the shapes? You did this in third grade.  Is this a review?",teacher,45,0,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"All the shapes, to be able to identify them.  Did we ever get to the sphere?",teacher,16,0,,,0.0

So it’s like a shadow.,student,5,0,,,
"It’s similar to a shadow.  So that’s what a silhouette is.  So this is showing you the silhouette of a shape.  If you look at a silhouette of a person, do you know it’s a person?",teacher,36,0,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
