No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  We can add three fourths using the same area, right? Enough to add.  We have three fourths left.  So what would be three fourths plus one fourth?  Four fourths.  We can color this in, and now we have what?",teacher,40,3,,,0.0

"There's some fractions that are kind of confusing.  For example, four eighths.  There's another fraction, four sixths, or something like that.  I don't get what they do with the bottom denominator.  I know you don't add them, but I don't get it.  Okay.  [Inaudible].  I don't get it.",student,48,4,,0.0,
"We started yesterday by using the same denominators, and most of you found that it wasn't that difficult to do the addition with the same denominators.  When I did that practice yesterday, that short quiz, I found that seven of you understood most of the concept of adding different denominators, and some of you did not.  Let's go back to your question.  Do you remember the numbers you used? Right now.  You said four sixths.",teacher,75,4,1.0,,0.0

The same denominator.,multiple students,3,1,,,
"We need to have the same denominator right?  This number on the bottom has to be the same number.  We have to have the same amount of parts to be able to add them, and Student A did something yesterday that she found she could do to get the same denominator.  Would you like to show us again what you did?  Okay.  Can you explain that?",teacher,66,3,,,1.0
"First I want to do 8 times 6 and put [inaudible] on each side. Then I did 8 times 4 is 32, and 6 times 4 is 24.  Then you need the denominator the same way you add the numerator. [Inaudible] is bigger, you have to try to make it, or divide it – yeah, divide it and see what you've got for a third or fourth, like that.",student,69,5,,0.0,
"Okay.  So first you found the same denominator that multiplied this number with this number.  So you multiplied the denominators on the bottom to find the same – to use the same denominators in your new fractions.  Then you multiplied across.  Do you see what she said?  She did 6 times 4, and that's how she got this 24, 48.  Hold on.  I want to complete this example first.  Then 8 times 4, and that's how she found 32, but then Student A – thank you, Student A.  Student A, if you see this problem, how would you add these two fractions?  By the way, Student A's answer is correct, 56 48.  Okay.  Now, let's look at Student A's strategy to find the answer.  This answer is also correct.  Did you notice that half of 56 is 28?  Half of 48 is 24.",teacher,143,9,1.0,,1.0

"Yeah.  What Student A just said is good to know.  Remember that.  If you say that seven sixths is one and one sixth, she said, ""For me to prove I'm right, I can use what I did. I multiplied this.  I added that.  I should get seven sixths.  That would mean that I got the right mixed number.""  My answer is yes.  Maybe later on I will give you some examples to see how you match mixed numbers with improper fractions, all right?  Just leave the ones you want to leave on the board.  While he does that, while we were meeting with the other teachers and talking about your learning scores, the good news is that almost all of you move up.  You show progress in reading, and you show progress in math, okay?  The other good news is that we have a lot to do still.  When we go in to geometry, measurement, and all that, we need to get really strong in those fields.  We showed a little weakness there, but we're doing good.  Okay.  Let me give you an example, okay?  Why don't you add three fifths plus two tenths?  How many of you went home to your math notebook, looked it over?  You did?  Nice.  I like that.  By the way, I was very impressed – while Student J finishes that – I was very impressed with your working with Mrs. S with these problems downstairs, and I see that a lot of you worked really hard.  This was Student C.  Wow.  Did Ms. S find that you were learning more about fractions and percents?  Very good.  Wow.  Yes? I'm sorry.  I'm just making sure [inaudible] has your names.  Wow.

"One thing I like about what Student J is doing now is that he's actually trying to follow Student A's model, and that's all I ask from you when you take your notebooks home.  Learn how to follow some of these models of doing these problems, because once you remember a pattern on how to go from here to here, you will not forget it.  You will see a fraction and say, ""I remember this.""  Then you will follow a pattern.  First I do this, then I do this, and then I get here.  Then I have to divide or find this mixed number. Yes, Student J?",teacher,107,3,,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"Up to now he's found that three fifths plus two tenths is twenty twenty-fifths.  Another thing that we had to take notice that I've seen many of you doing way better lately in your work, in your notebooks, is you are keeping your numbers – you're writing your numbers clearly.  You're putting things in a straight line.  If you multiply going down, you're doing problems going sideways, and that's very important.  If you miss putting a number where it belongs, it may confuse your answer.  It may get to a point in which your answer – you're adding, or taking away, or forgetting a number.  What Student J just did is perfect, right?  You can see how he went about the problem and how he came down to writing his answer at the end.  This is the correct answer, by the way.  Twenty twenty-fifth.  Yes, Student A?",teacher,147,3,,,0.0

"5.  Okay.  Then if we want we can add that here.  Equals four fifths.  Now if we want to change that answer, let's say the MCAS has four tenths has .80, has 70 percent, and has one and four fifths.  Which of these answers will be the right answer in an MCAS question?  B.  Why B, Student ?",teacher,58,3,,,1.0
Because four fifths is 80 percent.,student,6,1,,,
"Because four fifths is 80 percent, and if we change 80 percent to a decimal, it is what?  .80, or eighty hundredths. Remember, MCAS is always trying to stretch what you know. So they might give you a simple addition problem like this, but when they ask you to find the answer here, they might not go back to the fractions.  They might want to know if you know this number can be turned in to a decimal which is .80.  Always keep in mind what you know about fractions, what you know about percents, what you know about decimals, especially when you're taking the MCAS.",teacher,106,10,1.0,,0.0

I will know the moment I see your answer if there are problems, and then I will ask you to show it, because I want to know where you have the problems, okay?  Now let's mix things a little bit.  In 5th grade nothing is ever easy.  Remember that.  Now I'm going to think about – how do you subtract fractions?  First we're going to work a little bit more with addition of fractions, and then we're going to work with subtraction of fractions, because when you do the borrowing, if you need to, you need to do about two steps before you can do the subtraction.  It's a little bit more complex, but not difficult to do once you practice it often.  Okay.  Now I'm going to draw this rectangle here, and I'm going to say that this line right here measures – let's say 12 and one half centimeters, and this one here measures 9 centimeters.

Find the parameter.  Okay.  Student J? Do your math.  Be careful.  Now I'm testing two things that I want to see if you can combine.  One is knowing how you find the parameter, which we have practiced in the past. As a little review of that, I'm going to add the part that I'm using numbers with fractions, mixed numbers in the whole math process now.  Do we have an answer, or are you still working on it?  Do you have an answer?  Okay, Student A.  Student A, when we are looking for the parameter of a figure, what do we need to do?",teacher,140,6,1.0,,0.0

Let me see what I do here.  I'm going to do it up here. You said one third plus one third is two thirds.  Now you have to see one eighth plus one eighth.  What is that?",teacher,70,0,1.0,,0.0
"Student A told me any time you can add the lowest number, there's no lowest number.  They're both the same.",student,20,1,,1.0,
You don't have to do that in this case.  So what is 1 plus 1?,teacher,15,0,0.0,,0.0

Okay.  So your answer here is one eighth plus one eighth is two eighths.  Now you have to add these two numbers.  What is two thirds plus two eighths?  That's your work now.  I will be with you.  Yes?,teacher,39,1,,,0.0
I don't get this right here.,student,6,0,,,
"So you added this, then you divided by 2, got eleven twelfths. It's two eighths plus two thirds, two eighths plus two thirds, 6, 16, yeah.  You're right.  Now you have to add eleven twelfths to what?  46.  So what is 46 plus eleven twelfths?",teacher,45,2,0.0,,0.0
[Inaudible].,student,1,0,,,
"When we added these numbers we got to 46, right?  But when we added the fractions we didn't get to a whole number.  We only got to eleven twelfths.  That's the right answer. Wait until Student J comes back.  Yes?  You think you have the right answer?  That's a correct answer.  Very good. Okay.  Student A?",teacher,56,2,,,0.0
It's almost 47.,student,3,0,,,
"So when we add this here, 46 – we have no fractions on top of this fraction, right?  There's nothing to add, so it's 0 plus eleven twelfths equals—",teacher,29,4,,,0.0

46.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So the parameter is 46 and eleven twelfths centimeters.  Now 46 and eleven twelfths centimeters – but Student A said something we all have to keep in mind.  He said eleven twelfths is almost one.  So he said he didn't want to be wrong, so he said it's almost 47, which is true.  When you round it, it's 47.  What would be the question in the MCAS if they put 47 instead of 46 eleven twelfths?  What was the question?  What was the little word they used in the question?",teacher,90,2,,,0.0

About. Nearest. Closest.,student,3,0,,,
"They use that in the question about how many centimeters is the parameter of this figure.  Now you know once you've got it here, you've got to look closer to 47.  That's how it works, okay?  Remember that.  They want to know if you know how to do this.  They also want to know something else, and they know what is closest.  They're always trying to push you up one step.  Now we have to transfer ourselves, transition to reading.",teacher,80,1,,,0.0
