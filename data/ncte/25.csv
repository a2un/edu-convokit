Make a picture?,student,3,0,,,
"You could make a picture.  That might be a little tricky. Well, it’s telling you that total they eat a pizza, right? Student R, do you need to go take 5?  You seem a little grumpy for no reason.  Do you need help, because there’s another way to ask for it. Okay, so you cut it into thirds right now for the first one.",teacher,64,1,,,0.0
