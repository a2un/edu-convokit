"Okay, so here’s the fraction track that we started with yesterday.  And some of you got started.  Can somebody explain how they knew either how to fill in blank dots or where to add dots.  Student F?",teacher
Because if those – if it was in the fourth thing you only knew – you already knew that there [inaudible] 50 and 75 [inaudible] and 100 [Indiscernible] single one of them so we didn’t have to guess that.,student
"You’re right.  So these are all marked as one whole, which we’re also going to change into fractions as we go.  So, it sounds like you looked at the one out of fourths first.  Is that what you had said?  This one? So you knew what about fourths?",teacher
"That there was only four and there were only 25, 75 – I mean 25, 50, and 75 and 100 [inaudible] so you have to guess that one.",student
"Okay, so it sounds like you took the fractions and you changed them to what?",teacher
"Twenty five, fifty –",student
I don’t know what that means.  Can you explain that a little bit further?  Where did you get 25 from?,teacher
Is it recording or no?,student
Uh-huh.,teacher
Oh.,student
"It’s fine.  Don’t worry about the camera.  It’s just like a normal math day.  So, I liked what you said.  You know that it has 25, 50, and 75.  I’m just wondering where those numbers came from.",teacher
Twenty five [inaudible] I know where the [middle] –,student
But I wrote ¼.  I didn’t write 25.  So where are you getting 25 from?,teacher
I know that one-fourth is 25.  I know that two-fourth is 50. And I know that three-fourth is 75.,student
Okay.,teacher
And I know [inaudible],student
"Excellent.  You’re doing something, but you’re not explaining what you’re doing.  So you’re taking ¼ and you said you changed it to 25.  What does that mean that you changed it to 25?",teacher
I turned into a percent.,student
"Okay, thank you.  That’s what I was looking for.  So you changed it 25 percent, right?  Very good.  That’s a big difference so you want to remember to say that.  So, how many of you did that.  How many of you took this fraction track and thought of it as percents?  I’m just curious. Just a few of you?  Okay, because we have been working on that a lot so I thought a lot of people might do that. Excellent job. So, let’s focus in on this one since Student F pointed it out.  Is there something that is missing --",teacher
Yes.,student
In that fourths fraction track.  Student J?,teacher
We’re missing two-fourth.,student
Two-fourths. Excellent.  And does anyone know what two-fourth is equal to?  Student S?,teacher
Half.,student
A half.  So where should my dot be?,teacher
In the middle.,student
In the middle between what?,teacher
"One-fourth, one-fourth. And three-fourth. One-fourth –",student
"Okay, that’s true.  In the middle between here.  It should also – if I’m comparing all of my fraction tracks what else should I be looking at that I could compare it to?  So, yes, it should be in the middle between there.  Student T?",teacher
You shouldn’t look at the top.,student
"Okay.  We had the very first halfway mark labeled for us. Student T, since you weren’t here you should be filling this in as you go.  And I know a few others yesterday didn’t get to filling the entire chart out so this is your chance to check it because we’re using it for the game.",teacher
[Inaudible] in the middle [inaudible],student
"Excellent job with the two-fourth.  So, is our fourths track filled in completely?",teacher
Yes.,multiple students
How do we know?  Student D?,teacher
"‘Cause you can one-fourth, two-fourth and ¾.",student
"Okay, good.  So you were looking at the top number which is called –",teacher
The numerator.,student
"The numerator. We are looking at the numerator or the part and we see it go zero- fourth, one-fourth two-fourth, three-fourth one.  How could we change that to help us know that we really are correct? Student J?",teacher
The four-fourth.,student
"The four-fourth, good.  So I’m just going to put that in parenthesis to check my work.  You could do that, too, if you want to check your work.  It’s up to you.  Can somebody choose another track for us to finish off?  Student T?",teacher
We finish off the – six – I meant the eighths.,student
The eighths.,teacher
Yeah.,student
"Okay, very good.  So the eighths are a little more confusing, but we did learn a lot of the equivalent fractions.  So are there any fractions in the eighths that we know are equal to another fraction that might be already labeled on the chart?  It’s kind of a tricky question.  But I always think of that yummy chocolate bar that I let you guys eat, and remember it was broken up into four pieces? And then we had to make eight pieces out of it, and what did you do? Student B?",teacher
We broke it in half.,student
Good.  We broke those pieces in half and then we got to gobble them up.  So which one?,teacher
Two-eighths.,student
Two-eighths is equal to?,teacher
One-fourth.,student
One-fourth.  So that’s how you can check your work if they line up correctly.  We know that those two are equal.  Check that you did that.  Or they might have already had that one done for you.,teacher
Yes.,student
There’s another one or a couple more for the eighths that are equal to something else.  Does anybody know another fraction out of eight that is equal to something else on the chart?  Student J?,teacher
Four-eights.,student
Four-eights is equal to ½.  So that’s what I’m going to do. What’s the problem back there?,teacher
I don’t get this.,student
"So you did miss yesterday’s lesson so I will help you.  Just as a reminder, you might have missed yesterday; these are just like number lines. Do you remember how we worked on the fractions with the number line? So, each line is a number line.  This one is broken up into halves.  This one is going to be broken up into thirds, although it’s not complete, but if you look at this one, we finished this one.  So it’s just like a number line where we have lines to break them up.",teacher
"Oh, I’m [getting it.]",student
But now it’s in dots.  Okay?,teacher
[inaudible],student
"And they’re all lined up together because we’re using some information from other ones to help us fill in the rest. And it’s going to be a game board so we’re going to need – yes, Student S?",teacher
I know how to figure out the fraction.,student
"Okay, excellent.  Hold on because Student J just told me – what did you tell me?  Four-eights?  Yes?  And you told me it was equal to what?",teacher
One-half.,student
"One-half.  So that’s where I was lining them up, making sure that they’re lined up as best as I can.  It’s not going to be perfect. The important part is that you’re using the skills that you know because we know it’s not going to be perfect.  None of us are.  Right?",teacher
Right.,multiple students
"As long as you’re trying to line things up and make them even. Like you can see right here, these piece aren’t equal but should they be?",teacher
Yeah.,multiple students
Yes.  Each eighths should be equal.  I didn’t do a very good job on that part.  Okay?  So just be aware that you’re trying to make them even pieces.  Student D?,teacher
[inaudible] [is organized] [inaudible],student
"Very good.  And we’re going to talk about why not all of them do have a dot in the middle though.  So hold that thought. Student S, you were going to do six-eighth.",teacher
[inaudible] one-six [inaudible] I know how to figure [inaudible],student
I thought you were – before you mentioned that you knew six- eighths was equal to something.  No?,teacher
No.,student
Okay.  So what did you want to do?,teacher
The one – the number six.,student
"Okay.  Let’s first finish the eighths since we started them. Let’s go – let’s complete a whole track before we move on. So, Student K, you have another one?",teacher
Sixth-eighth is also three-fourth.,student
"Very good.  So, six-eighths should have been lined up with three-fourths.  Those are equal.  We should have that memorized by now and you should be able to prove it.  We’re still missing quite a few on the eighths chart or eights line though.  Student B?",teacher
Five-eighths is equal to two-thirds.,student
Five-eighths is equal to two-thirds.  Let’s see.  Five-eighths is equal to two-thirds.  Is that true?,teacher
No.,multiple students
Can we show something –,teacher
[Inaudible],student
Sorry.  Five-eighths.  We don’t have five-eighths down yet.,teacher
If you put it right there –,student
Well do you remember – does anyone remember what five-eighths as a percent?,teacher
Yeah.,student
Challenge question. Student S?,teacher
Thirty three [inaudible],student
"That’s four-eighths as a percent, Student S.",teacher
[Inaudible],student
Four out of eight.,teacher
Fifty.,student
Fifty percent.  So that might help you get to five-eighths. Student S?,teacher
Sixty two point five percent.,student
Sixty two point five percent -- stamp it in your brain – is five-eighths.  Do you remember what two-thirds is?,teacher
Yeah.,student
What?,teacher
Sixty-six and two-thirds.,student
"Sixty-six and two-thirds.  They’re really close, right?  So they’re going to look almost lined up but they’re not exact.  Thank you for bringing that up.  So, you guys look. We have zero-eighths.  We have two-eighths, three-eighths, six-eighths, one whole.  We’re missing quite a few.  Could you help me out, Student J?",teacher
You’re missing one-eighths and five-eighths.,student
Where should one-eighths be?,teacher
In between zero-eighths and two-eighths.,student
"Excellent job.  Right in the middle it should be.  Is one- eighths.  So now we have zero-eighths, one-eighths, two- eighths, three-eighths, four-eighths.",teacher
"Oh, I forgot five-eighths.",student
"Student T, help us out.",teacher
We forgot five-eighths  and  four-eighths.,student
We have four –,teacher
Four-eights is in there.  It’s supposed to – the five-eighths is supposed to be in the middle of four-eighths and six- eighths.,student
Excellent job.  Yes.,teacher
[inaudible] seven-eighths.,student
Student M?,teacher
Seven-eighths is supposed to be in between six-eighths and a whole.,student
You got it.  So double check that you have that on your chart. Let’s also tell what one whole is so that we can double check our work.  Student J.,teacher
[inaudible],student
"No, as the eights.",teacher
Eight-eighths is one whole.  Just so that we can practice.  Is that all on your paper?,student
And they’re trying to be as even as possible between the dots?,teacher
Yes.,student
Very good.  Somebody mentioned they want to go to sixes next.,teacher
Student S.,student
"Student S, you want to start us off?",teacher
I done found out – I done found out where three-sixths goes.,student
Excellent.  Because?,teacher
Because it’s equal to ½.,student
"Very good.  So, I’m going to line them up.  We have three-sixes is equal to one half, all that work we did the other day with it.  Very good.  Anything else we can label?  Student N.",teacher
Four-six.,student
Four-sixes where?,teacher
In between three-sixths and five-sixths.,student
Very good.,teacher
[inaudible],student
"So we have zero-sixths, two-sixths, three-sixths, four-sixths, five-sixths.  We’re still missing some, Student B.",teacher
One-sixth.,student
"Very good.  They have the dot for you so you don’t need to think about that one.  And then just to double check our work, one whole, Student M, is equal to what out of six?",teacher
Huh?,student
One whole?,teacher
[Inaudible] No.,student
We’re working on fractions.,teacher
I don’t know what you’re talking about.,student
Okay.  We’ve been labeling the fractions.,teacher
I don’t know.,student
"Can you not be like that, please.",teacher
"Teacher, what are you talking about.",student
"Okay, if you’re – if you think about a picture and you broke it up into six boxes and you colored in the whole thing what fraction would that be?",teacher
What is one whole of six?,student
How many pieces out of six would you have colored in?,teacher
Six.,student
"Okay, so what fraction is it?",teacher
Six-sixths.,student
"Yes, thank you very much.  Excellent job, Student M. Okay, so we have this one done.  I’m going to put out of two just to speed it up.  We don’t have this finished.  We worked on this one.  So we have fifths, tenths, and thirds to go, and then we can get to the game.",teacher
Student M.,student
Student C.,teacher
You want me to do fifths?,student
Sure.,teacher
"Well, you don’t have to really add any dots, just put one- fifths.",student
"Okay, so here we have one-fifth.  Very good.  Student S?",teacher
Three-fifths.,student
Three-fifths goes?,teacher
Between two-fifths and four-fifths.,student
"You got it.  And then one whole.  Let’s finish it off.  Student K?  Out of fifth, what does one whole equal to?",teacher
[inaudible],student
"Good, five-fifths.  That should be on your paper, too, even though didn’t require it.  It’s good practice.  Two more to go.  What do you want to do next?  Oh goodness, Student J?",teacher
One-third.,student
"Good, one-third.  Where do you think one-third goes?",teacher
In the middle.,student
"About in between.  Very good.  Zero-thirds and two-thirds, so it should be about this size and if we go in the middle it should be. Excellent job, one-third, so we have zero-thirds, one-thirds, two- thirds, and we have one whole.  What does one whole equal to out of thirds, Student M?",teacher
You just called on me.,student
I know.  You did so awesome I want you to do it again.,teacher
No. Oh my God.,student
Just one whole out of three.,teacher
Student M [inaudible] No.,student
"I know.  Student N, could you sit in Student T’s seat but with your notebook – with your math book.",teacher
Student M [inaudible],student
How about Student N?  Could you tell us what one whole is out of three?,teacher
[inaudible],student
Three out of three.  Excellent job.,teacher
"[Inaudible] Yay, Student N.",student
Okay.  Last one should feel like the easiest one.  I think this is what I saw most people do right off the bat.  I know how you love your tenths.  Student J.,teacher
The second dot is two-tenths.,student
"Good.  The second dot is two-tenths.  Student K, could you tell me one to label.",teacher
Three-tenths.,student
Three-tenths goes where?,teacher
I can’t -- that’s the [inaudible],student
Very good.  Anything else?  Student B?,teacher
Four-tenths.,student
Goes where?,teacher
In the middle.,student
How would I know – right here?,teacher
"Make a dot, yeah.",student
"I know.  I didn’t do a very good job with this part.  After four-tenths we have – Student K, what comes after four- tenths.",teacher
Five-tenths.,student
Five-tenths.  Do you know what five-tenths is equal to?,teacher
Fifty percent.,student
Fifty percent or equal to what fraction?,teacher
A half. Student K.,student
How is five – it’s okay. How is five related to ten?,teacher
She know she knows.,student
Or you said you know that five-tenths is 50 percent.  Do you know what 50 percent is as fraction?,teacher
Half.,student
"Other than five-tenths, can you think of another fraction that is equal to 50 percent.",teacher
Oh.,student
"Fernando, that wasn’t helpful.",teacher
"Yeah, it wasn’t helpful. Oh, one-half.",student
Thank you.  So we’re going to wind it up then with the halves that we already have.  Five-tenths.  The next one would be six-tenths.  And then I don’t have dots.  So what else do I need to add?  Student C?,teacher
Another dot.,student
Good.  How would I know where to put the next dot?,teacher
Well just kind of close to the six-tenths but not in the middle.,student
"Okay, good.  So, can somebody explain how they can use the information that is already on the table to kind of know where the other dot should go?  Student J?",teacher
"If you [inaudible] seven-tenths, if you put your [inaudible] out where – if you put your index finger and your thumb [inaudible] and measure it and then it put it where – and then put your thumb on six-tenths and [inaudible]",student
"Okay.  So, it sounds like you’re saying measure here, right? Because between each dot it should be what?",teacher
[inaudible],student
Student B.,teacher
[inaudible],student
"Yeah.  Remember, whenever we make our fractions each group needs to be the same amount, from all those drawings we practiced.  So, it’s not going to be perfect but we’re going to do our best at it.  So this is seven-tenths. And nine-tenths.  Okay.",teacher
"Nope, you forgot something.",student
"Oh, thank you, Student T.  Ten-tenths is one whole.  Very good. Okay, so this is very important that you have it because we’re going to play the game with this fraction track.  And the game is kind of like – it reminds me of that packet that you did, the fraction packet – Do you – but no, it’s way more fun than that.  Don’t worry. But do you remember where this was this confusing problem where somebody like ran a certain amount each day?",teacher
"Yeah, and I almost did get it –",student
"So, no, it’s not like that but you’re – it’s going to be a track and we’re going to practice on this board, and then you’re going to get to play. Your goal—there are going to be some tiles on each spot in your track and your goal is to get the tile to one, to land exactly on one.  And if you do you win the tile.  And your goal is to get as many tiles as you can.  So what I’m going to do is I printed out official game board papers.  So what you can do is close your book.  I will pass book one bag goes for each table, okay?  One bag for each table.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  One, two. Student M is absent.  What did the doctor say?  I mean the nurse.",teacher
She said that I got to move slowly [inaudible] but all [inaudible],student
"Okay.  Can you bring this to the nurse, please?  Okay.  So you have your game pieces and now you are getting a fraction track board, okay?  Same one you already have but this one is the professionally made, just in case there were any mistakes, okay?  Name and date goes on the top.",teacher
How do we know how to play?,student
"Well then you’re going to get the directions and we’re going to go over them. Oh, actually, only one per team.  One per team.",teacher
What do you mean one person?,student
One paper per team.,teacher
Oh. [inaudible],student
"In a minute.  Okay.  One – please pass it back.  So we are going to look first at the directions.  That’s the most important part.  And the directions, the title says Fraction Track, and the first page says one of two. Fraction Track one of two.  You’re sharing so I’m waiting to see that you have it in front of you because the directions are not very clear. So I can see that Student N and Student Y are ready.  I can see Student S and Student D are ready; Student K and Student S are doing a good job.  We’re looking at the paper says Fraction Track one of two on it.  It has the directions. Thank you, Student J and Student J look ready.  Student F and Student J look ready.  Student T and Student B look ready.  And then we’re just waiting for Student K and Student K to sit up and show that ready.",teacher
Huh?,student
Sit up.,teacher
Oh.,student
"Okay, so first of all, you need fraction cards.  I put them in color for you, so they’re a little bit different so that they don’t get mixed up with somebody else’s.  So, please be aware of the colors that you have.  You also need chips, which are in the bag.  I haven’t asked anyone to touch any of the pieces.",teacher
What?,student
"And you need the game board, which I already passed out.  The game board is the fraction tracks, okay?  So the game board should look like this so that the lines are going across.",teacher
"Oh, this is cool.",student
And the first thing is to remove any percent cards that are in the bag.  So the bags do have some percent cards.  So I’ll give you a minute to do that.  You don’t want any fraction cards that are greater than one or any percent cards.  What are those fractions called that are bigger than one? Student N?,teacher
[inaudible] fractions.,student
"Oh, no, good guess though.  Student K?",teacher
Improper.,student
"Improper fractions.  So, any improper fraction put back into the bag.  And I’m going to give you a minute to do that.",teacher
[inaudible],student
Take out any improper fractions.,teacher
"No, that’s – improper fractions is more than one.",student
Give half to your partner so you guys can speed up the process. What’s your question?,teacher
[inaudible],student
All of those are fine.  This like is an improper fraction. Why?,teacher
‘Cause it [inaudible],student
Good.  It has more where?  What’s that called?,teacher
[inaudible],student
But you said the top.  What do you mean by top?  What is that called?,teacher
Numerator.  The numerator.,student
"Good, the numerator.",teacher
[inaudible],student
Is that greater than one?,teacher
[inaudible],student
Nope.  So percents and any improper fractions are going back in t he bag.  Looking good.,teacher
-- equal to one.,student
Do you know if five-fifths and improper fraction?,teacher
No. No. It’s a [inaudible],student
That’s okay.  As long as – All of your fractions should be fractions that are out of these denominators.  But did you take out all of the improper fractions?,teacher
I tried to but –,student
"Oh, there’s not – oh.  Student K, what’s the matter with you today?",teacher
I’m tired.,student
Okay.  I’m sorry that you’re tired.,teacher
I didn’t get no sleep last night.,student
"Okay, I’m sorry.  So I’ll call mom and talk to her about that, but I still need you to work hard today.",teacher
Because I went to the [inaudible],student
Okay.,teacher
I’m tired.,student
"But I still need you to try hard today.  Can you do that?  It’s almost lunch time.  Do you think you can try for math? Okay, thank you. All right.  If you haven’t finished then I will give you time in a little bit.  I see a card already on the floor over there. So I have these little like – they’re kind of like post-its because I don’t – if I put a chip on the board – on my board what’s going to happen?",teacher
It’s going to fall.,student
It’s going to fall down.  So I’m using a post-it.  But we’re going to read the directions and play on this board to practice and then you’ll get to play as a team at your table.  We have 30 minutes before lunch.  So we should only have to spend five minutes practicing the game and then you should get about 20 minutes in order to play with a partner.  How much time does that leave us? Student D?,teacher
Five more minutes.,student
Five more minutes.  That’s to talk about how your game went.,teacher
Five more minutes.,student
"Oh, I said we shouldn’t have to spend more than five minutes going over the directions.",teacher
Okay.,student
"So if you’re not finished separating the cards, please stop and you will have time after we go over the directions. Okay.  So let’s read number one.  How about Student N?",teacher
To move the percent cards and the [inaudible] card greater than one such as [inaudible] you only [inaudible] one of the fractions [inaudible] from zero to one.,student
"Excellent.  So, I’m not sure everyone’s clear.  We are done touching the pieces.  Right now we are reading the directions.  Thank you.  Okay, we already did that.  And if you didn’t finish that that’s what you’re going to do when you stop going over the directions.  Number two is important.  What does number two say, Student K?",teacher
"Place seven chips on the game board, one on each track.  Any fraction point less than [three-fourths], mix the cards and place them face down.",student
Okay.  So that was a ton of information.  What is one thing that they said?  Student J?,teacher
To put seven chips on the game boar d.,student
"Okay.  So I need seven chips.  I’m going to take seven sticky notes.  Now, where do I need to put the pieces?  They were very specific about how to put the pieces on the game board.  Student D?",teacher
We put it on the – Do we do that?,student
Nope.,teacher
On each track.,student
"Okay.  So, how many chips, for example, can I put on the second track, the one of thirds?",teacher
Two.,student
How many chips can I put on this one?  Student Y?,teacher
Three.,student
"Three?  Well let’s read what it says.  It says place seven chips on the game board, one on each track at any fraction point less than three-fourths.  So for this track –",teacher
Oh.,student
"-- how many chips am I allowed to put on it,  Student Y?",teacher
One.,student
One.  Only one.  And can I put it on three-thirds? No.  Why not?  Student T?,teacher
Because if you put it on – you supposed to put it on – you supposed to put it on less than three-fourths.,student
Very good.  Because three-thirds is not less than three- fourths.,teacher
Exactly.,student
"Okay?  Because it’s one whole and three-fourths is less than one whole.  Very good, Student T.  So, we have to put it somewhere less than three-fourths, anywhere on the board but less than three-fourths.  So, where is one place that I could put a chip?  Student J?",teacher
One one-third.,student
"On one-third.  Very good.  I’ve used this track already.  Now there’s one there, so I can not add another one on that. Please put it down so that you don’t lose the opportunity to play.  Put it down.  Thank you.  Student S?",teacher
One-half.,student
One-half.  Is that less than three-fourths?,teacher
Yes.,student
Very good.  I can put it right there.  Student T?,teacher
You could put it on one-fourth.,student
One-fourth.  Very good.  Student B?,teacher
Put it on one-fifth.,student
One-fifth.  I’m seeing a pattern.  It doesn’t have to be on the first one.  It just has to be less than three-fourths. Student S?,teacher
You can put it on three-eighths.,student
"Three-eighths.  Very good.  One, two, three, four, five.  We need two more.  Student Y?",teacher
You can put it on seven-tenths.,student
"Seven-tenths.  Very good.  One track to go.  Somewhere there that’s less than three-fourths.  Student K, can you find a point on the sixes that is less than three-fourths?",teacher
You can put it on one-sixth.,student
"One-sixth.  You got it.  Okay? Now, when you’re playing with your partner it’s up to you where you put the chips.  But you have to follow the rules.  So, what has to happen when you’re deciding where the chips go? Student T?",teacher
It has to be less than three-fourths.,student
Good.  One is that it has to be less than three-fourths.  Who can tell me what percent that is equal to?  Student J?,teacher
Seventy-five.,student
"Seventy-five percent.  So if you feel more comfortable with converting these to percents that can help you also.  So, one is that it’s less than three-fourths?  What’s the other rule?",teacher
[inaudible],student
Student S?,teacher
One could be – only one chip can be on the track.,student
"Very good.  The other rule is that only one chip can be on the track.  And how many chips do you need to use, student N? Oh, you don’t – how many chips do you need to use, Student K?",teacher
Seven.,student
"Seven.  Which would mean one chip on each track, okay?",teacher
I can’t see.,student
"Question.  You can’t see?  Oh, move your seat so you can see. There you go. You won’t have to see it once you’re on your own.  So if you can’t see right now because of the camera then just scoot your chair somewhere so that you can see.  Okay.  So now comes the fun part.",teacher
Yeah.,student
"Your goal is to get a chip to land on one.  If it lands on one you’re winning and it’s your chip, okay?",teacher
I don’t get the – What? You get –,student
We’re going to get there.  So we’re going to read the directions but we’re going to play around on here.,teacher
Uh-oh.,student
"So, Student K, would you like to read number three?",teacher
Oh [inaudible],student
Yep.,teacher
[inaudible] the top part –,student
I’m sorry.  I can’t hear because people are being really rude right in front of me.,teacher
"Oh no. Players take turns drawing a top card and moving a chip [inaudible] to total the amount shown.  You can move on one track or on several.  For example, if the car is three- fifths you can move three-fifths on the fifth line, six- tenths on the tenth line, or a combination of moves on two or more lines. What? Such as one-half and one-tenths, one-fifth and four-tenths or one-third, one-sixth, and one-tenth.  The fraction.",student
"Okay.  Hold on.  I’m going to pause you. Because you’re doing awesome, Student K.",teacher
Okay.,student
"But it’s a whole lot of information, right?",teacher
"Yes, and [I’m not] –",student
And I already heard some people go huh?,teacher
I don’t understand it.,student
"Right.  So we want to pause before we get to the bottom because if you already don’t understand it there’s no point in continuing. So we’re going to start at the top, okay?",teacher
[inaudible] moose.,student
"Players take turns drawing the top card and moving a chip or chips to the total amount shown.  So, you’re going to – all those cards that you picked out, all the cards that aren’t improper fractions or percents you should have in a pile, unless you didn’t finish that step and you’re going to go on and get to it.  I have it right here.  We’re going to mix those cards up and have it face down, kind of like when you play gold fish or something, okay?  You’re going to have them face down.  And when it’s your turn you’re going to pick one up, okay?",teacher
Okay.,student
"Their sample is – they said pretend that you picked a card and it said three-fifths. You’re goal is to move the chips three-fifths of the way.  And what they said is you’re allowed to break up three-fifths, okay? So what you could do, for example, is you could say – you could break it up let’s say into two-fifths plus one-fifth, okay?  Does anyone know what two-fifths is equal to, either from looking at your fraction charge or just because you have it memorized?  Student K?",teacher
Forty percent.,student
Forty percent.  So what other fraction on the board is two- fifths equal to?  Student F?,teacher
Huh?,student
What other fraction on the board is two-fifths equal to?,teacher
Three-tenths.,student
Three-tenths?,teacher
I mean three-eighths.,student
Well did you hear what Student K just said?,teacher
"Yeah, he said it was 40 percent.",student
He said it was equal to 40 percent.  Do you know another fraction that is equal to 40 percent?,teacher
"Oh, yeah, like four-tenths.",student
Four-tenths.  So what you could do is you could move your fifths – you could just move this one one-fifth and then you could move this one – wait a minute.,teacher
[inaudible],student
Where was – did we put this on seven-tenths?,teacher
Uh-huh.,student
"And then you could move this one four-tenths.  One, two, three, and can’t do it, right, you’d go over one?",teacher
Yeah.,student
So that doesn’t work.  But did you see how I took three-fifths and I moved a little bit on one track and a little bit on another?,teacher
Uh-huh.,student
So you’re allowed to do that as long as you what? As long as whatever you move is equal to three-fifths.  So another way – how else could you have done it so you could move on the tenths?  Student S?,teacher
[inaudible],student
"I’m sorry it’s not very clear.  So we have – we picked up three- fifths, right?",teacher
Yes.,student
We’re trying to move three-fifths.,teacher
Uh-huh.,student
"One thing is you could – this was originally here – you could take this tile and move one, two, three, right?  That would be the easiest for now.  But as they start to get closer to one  you might have to start breaking up where you move it. You might – it’s confusing just because it’s brand new.  A lot of things are confusing when it’s brand new.  You might want to do – what is one-fifth equal to, Student B?",teacher
Twenty percent.,student
"Twenty percent.  What other fraction is 20 percent? Two-tenths.  So you might want to say oh, I’ll go two-tenths with this one--one two, right?  That’s equal to one-fifth.  And then maybe I’ll go two-fifths over here and then I total three-fifths.",teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay?,teacher
Okay. [inaudible] game.,student
"So let’s pick another card.  Let’s keep on moving because what is the goal of the game,  Student J?",teacher
To win.,student
"It’s to land on whole so that you win the chip, okay?  If you end up going past one whole you can’t move the chip.  It can’t go more than one whole.",teacher
Can we play now?,student
"In a minute.  We’re going to do one more step.  So let’s see, I picked four-tenths.  Does anyone know what four-tenths is also equal to, Student D?",teacher
[inaudible],student
I couldn’t hear you.,teacher
Forty percent.,student
Forty percent.  True.  Is there another fraction that it’s equal to?,teacher
Yeah.,student
Student T?,teacher
Five – I mean two on five.,student
"Okay, good.  Or two-fifths. So let’s look.  Is there a good move that we could do to land on one whole if we landed on four-tenths?  Can anybody try to see if there is a way -- we can write down what we said.  So we took a card that says four-tenths.  Student D told us that that was equal to forty percent.  And then Student T also said that it’s also equal to two-fifths.  So, look on the track.  Were could we move in order to land on one whole? Student B?",teacher
On three-fifths you could move two-fifths.,student
"Very good.  So if we’re at three-fifths and we go one, two, we would land on one whole.  Is two-fifths equal to four- tenths?",teacher
Uh-huh.,multiple students
"Oh yeah, I think it is.",student
Yes or no?,teacher
No.  I don’t know. Definitely.,student
Student K? How do you know?,teacher
Because they’re both forty percent.,student
"Okay.  Because they’re both forty percent.  They’re equal.  So you are allowed to move – you are allowed to move fractions that are equivalent, okay?  Your goal is to move the distance of the card that you picked.  Yes?",teacher
She’s confused.,student
Okay.  I will come around to individual groups.  I want to let some groups that are ready be able to start.,teacher
[inaudible],student
Once I see that you’re doing something productive I’m happy to let you use the bathroom.,teacher
Are we ready [inaudible],student
Are there other questions?,teacher
No.,student
You guys feel like you could play?,teacher
Yes.,student
Yes?  Student K and Student K?  You two feel okay about it? Yes?,teacher
[inaudible],student
"Not your group?  Student S, you get it or no?  Okay.  And you two don’t?",teacher
"Yeah, we get it.",student
You two are okay?,teacher
Yep.,student
"And then Student N, I’ll deal with you in a little bit.  And then what about Student M and Student S?",teacher
I’m good.,student
Okay.,teacher
"[Inaudible] the game. No.  [Again he’s lying]. I get it, Student  T.",student
I will check in with you.  So your goal is to get started.  You have the directions in front of you to remind you how many chips to use and how to start the game board. Okay.  Did you separate the cards out?  These are all of your cards.,teacher
Uh-huh.,student
"Good.  And where is your game board?  Okay. Oh goodness.  You’re right.  Okay, I’m sorry, you guys.  The game board that I gave you is not the correct one.  It’s blank, right?",teacher
Yes.,student
So you need to use the one we just filled out in your book. I’m sorry.,teacher
Could we fill it out? No –,student
Or if you – I know but the back is greater than one.,teacher
Can we just fill it out?,student
If it’s quick.  I want you to be able to at least try to play. So do you want to open one of your books and use one of your book ones?,teacher
[inaudible],student
What?,teacher
Why?,student
"‘Cause this one’s not filled out.  See how it’s blank on a lot of them.  So just decide on whose – you don’t need both; you just need one of them. Okay, go quickly.",teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay.  So can you get the pieces started?  Do you remember how many pieces to use and where to put them?,teacher
Yeah.,student
Okay.  And then I’ll come back and check when he’s back from the bathroom.  Okay.  How about – you’re filling that one in?,teacher
"[inaudible] My first card’s right here, two-eighths.",student
Okay.  We don’t – you don’t have a card yet until you started the game board. So this one’s already done.  Wouldn’t that be more efficient just to use the one that’s already filled out?  Okay.  And what was the first step to do?  Do you guys remember?,teacher
[inaudible] chips.,student
Yes.,teacher
[Inaudible],student
Right.  And you remember where they’re allowed to go?,teacher
Anywhere,student
What?,teacher
Anywhere.,student
"Not anywhere, so look at the directions.",teacher
On each chart -- one chip on each –,student
One on each chart and then there was another specific direction.,teacher
And it’s got to be 75 less.,student
Less than – good – three-fourths.  So maybe you can put some on and she can put some on so that you’re sharing.,teacher
If I get to pick out [inaudible],student
"This actually – I’m sorry, I photocopied the wrong thing for you so could you use your filled out one in the book? Looks good.",teacher
Three-fourth –,student
Well it’s not completely filled out.  Is yours completely filled out.,teacher
I took out three-fourths so three-fourths [inaudible],student
"Student S, could you make yours look like the one that’s up on the board?  This one’s not done.  I think all the others are fine.  There you go.  That looks good.  So it has to be – let’s put this here so Student M can see too.  These are all the ones you took out?",teacher
Uh-huh.,student
Okay.  So it has to be less than three-fourths.  So if you put it on three-fourths is that less than three-fourths?,teacher
No.,student
"So that’s not an option.  But if you each have maybe three or four of the pieces – remember, you guys, it has to be less than three-fourths.  Are all of those less than three- fourths?",teacher
Three-fourths is 75 percent.,student
Right.  So are all of the tiles less than three-fourths?,teacher
[inaudible],student
That looks good.  There’s one.  You want to put one on.  Did something happen?,teacher
[Indiscernible],student
Did you do something to her?,teacher
No.,student
"What’s the matter? Can you put your tiles on? And Student D, did you check that they are all definitely less than three-fourths where you put the tiles?  Oh, please check that. This is the very first way to start so this shouldn’t be taking that long.  So put it on the board somewhere.",teacher
Doesn’t she have to pick up a card.,student
"We’re not there yet.  Your board’s not set up.  So the rules, Student M, are that they have to be less than three-fourths where you start the chips.",teacher
"Oh, you have to put all of them on there?",student
"Did you not listen to any of the lesson?  I’m a little confused.  So, do you want me to give you guys a chance to look over the directions and try it on your own?  ‘Cause you’re not – I don’t seem to be able to communicate with you.",teacher
I don’t get this [inaudible],student
That’s because you were fooling around when I was teaching.,teacher
I wasn’t fooling around.,student
I wasn’t watching you.,teacher
"Uh-uh, I was confused about what you were saying so I didn’t do it.",student
"Okay.  So, do you want me to explain it now?",teacher
Yes.,student
Or you just want to continue being confused?,teacher
I want you to explain it.,student
Okay.  So I printed this out for you to read along and we went over the steps.  It said place seven chips – these are the chips – place seven chips on the game board.  So how many do you need?,teacher
Six.  Seven.,student
"And it says one on each track.  These are each track.  So you have to put one on each.  Thank you, Student S.  And it says that it has to be – it can be on any fraction that you want, but it has to be less than three-fourths.  So would you agree he put them all on a fraction that’s less than three-fourths?",teacher
Yes.,student
Excellent.  So now you guys are ready to start.  Now is when – is this your pile of cards?,teacher
Yes.,student
"Okay, you just need one big pile. Okay.  So figure out where it would go.",teacher
Two-fourths is fifty percent.,student
You got one but there’s seven to get.,teacher
Now what?,student
"Take turns.  Sorry, you guys, I wasn’t clear.  So, well, one, I would  like your math notebook out because you’re probably – just like we needed to write some things down, you’re probably going to need to do some work to help make sure that you’re moving the right amount.  Okay?  So a math notebook out to show what you’re doing would be excellent. Not your workbook but your notebook to take notes.  Okay, so let’s practice for a couple rounds.  So you take the top card.  That can be down on the table.  There you go, nine- nines.  Well can you go nine-nines from any of these without going over one?",teacher
No.,student
No ‘cause none of them start on zero.  So you can’t move –,teacher
This one [inaudible],student
"Well now it does but it wasn’t like that.  Let’s leave it where it is so we can try to play the real game.  Okay, Student M, you go.  Take a card.  Okay, you guys did –",teacher
We did separate them but – [inaudible] your cards. She didn’t separate all of her –,student
"Okay, that’s fine.  Take another one.  Seven-tenths.  Okay. Could you find a track to go seven-tenths?",teacher
"Oh, I get it now.",student
Okay.,teacher
[Inaudible],student
"Okay, I will help you.  So is this where you started?  Yes? Okay, looks good.  And I’m a little confused.  What about the green one?",teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay.,teacher
[inaudible],student
That’s okay.  And is this your pile of cards?,teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay.  And you turned around two-fourths.  So there are a few things because two-fourths is equal to quite a lot.  What is two-fourths equal to?,teacher
Fifty percent.,student
"Fifty percent.  So, your goal is –",teacher
Is two the bottom or the top?,student
"Oh, that’s a good question.  Your goal is to move 50 percent anywhere that you want.  So you could move 20 percent in one spot and thirty percent in another.",teacher
If I go here that’s seventy-five percent.,student
"That’s two-fourths, so that would work.",teacher
"So, Teacher?",student
You could do that.,teacher
I keep getting cards that’s above three-fourths.,student
"Okay, I’ll be right with your group.",teacher
"Teacher, when you win, like when do you – when you get up to a whole what do you do?",student
You win that piece.  Your goal is to win as many pieces as possible.,teacher
Oh. So I moved one –,student
You moved one-fourth there then --,teacher
And then I got another one-fourth.,student
You have one-fourth and that’s also equal to something out of ten.,teacher
What?,student
"If you’re going to move one-fourth in one spot you have one- fourth left to go, right, which is equal to what percent?",teacher
Twenty-five percent.,student
Twenty-five percent.  Can you move twenty-five percent on this line?,teacher
No.,student
"No, ‘cause that counts by ten percents, right?",teacher
"I can move it here.  No, I can’t.",student
No.,teacher
"I can move it here.  No, I can’t.",student
"Right, that’s your only option, if you’re going to separate it that way.",teacher
I get it.,student
"Okay.  So now you get to choose one, Student J.  Okay, I’m sorry for the confusion.  Is this – this is where you all – you started all of your pieces, somebody got to one whole?",teacher
Yeah.,student
Yeah?,teacher
"Yeah, she got two to one whole.",student
Oh my goodness.,teacher
She won.,student
"Oh my gosh.  Way to go, Student K.  So, but are you understanding how to play?",teacher
[inaudible],student
Excellent.  So could one of you take out a notebook to show the math that you’re doing?,teacher
[inaudible],student
How are you guys doing?,teacher
We doing good.,student
"Okay, one game board.  You have two game boards out.",teacher
But we don’t know which one is ours if we don’t use two game boards.,student
"Okay, you’re going to have to start over ‘cause you can’t play with two game boards.",teacher
[inaudible],student
"Yes, I was waiting for you to get back.  So just start a fresh round, okay?  Since it looks like that part was little confusing.  So you’re going to use yours?",teacher
Yes.,student
"Excellent.  And so, just make sure you start in the right spot, you know, where the tiles have to go.  Six-eighths if fine.",teacher
[inaudible] like when you get –,student
"You could if you want, yes.  For example, if Student T said that for six-eighths she did one-fourth and she did – she did one-fourth and she did one-half, then you would show six-eighths equals one-fourth plus one-half.",teacher
So what did you do?,student
Are you guys okay?,teacher
"Yeah, we all right.",student
You were just frustrated ‘cause you kept getting bad cards?,teacher
Yeah.,student
Okay.,teacher
Teacher.,student
Okay.  Can you guys not work together?,teacher
He just mad ‘cause I don’t want to work with him.,student
"Okay, I’m sorry that you feel that way.",teacher
He just made ‘cause I won. Nuh-uh [inaudible],student
"Can you not kick each other, please.",teacher
Can I move?,student
I would like you to try to work together.,teacher
"No. Just try, Student M. No [inaudible]",student
Oh bummer.,teacher
[inaudible],student
No.,teacher
Okay.,student
It turns over.  Did you go somewhere else or you just said you couldn’t go?,teacher
I couldn’t go.,student
Oh.  If you guys want to play where you’re working together then you should help each other out with something like that.,teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay.,teacher
Teacher.  She not [inaudible] she don’t know how to play.,student
You guys can play with three people then if she’s going to refuse to play.,teacher
[Inaudible],student
"Oh.  Well that’s refusing.  Why don’t you guys try one more round ‘cause you don’t understand how to play, Student S?",teacher
She don’t know how to play.,student
"I know, but she needs you to help her.",teacher
[inaudible],student
"Okay, this – why doesn’t this work?  Did you read the directions about putting the tiles on the tracks?  Okay. What did it say about the tracks?",teacher
[inaudible],student
If you can hear me clap once. If you can hear me clap twice. Okay.  I apologize because this is a more complicated game –,teacher
Yes.,student
-- and it’s only day one.,teacher
[inaudible],student
"I’ll wait. Can you go back to your seat, Student S.",teacher
All right.,student
"Oh, I meant just where you were for a minute.  So, I want you to know that it’s day one and it’s going to be hard on day one.  I’m trying to think of something that was really hard and then all of a sudden you guys, as you practice you were like ooh, I like this.  Do you remember that happening with anything else in math?  Student S.",teacher
[inaudible],student
Something from the past.  Student K?,teacher
Fractions.,student
"Fractions.  A lot of people start off fractions saying oh, my God, I hate fractions.  And most of you right now seem to be enjoying them.  So it’s something – when something in math is hard it’s something to be aware of, to say I am aware that I’m feeling this way, that it’s frustrating, that it’s hard, but what is going to make it easier?  What made fractions easier?  Student K?",teacher
Practicing.,student
"Practicing.  So as we practice playing the game -- we’re going to get to play tomorrow, too – it’s going to start to get easier. What I do need you to do is to put all of the chips into the bag and all of the cards into the bag.  Look all over the floor and make sure that there aren’t any chips or any cards anywhere.  Please help clean up, Student S.",teacher
She’s not going to do it.,student
"And then zip them and just leave them on your table. Yep, after I see that you guys have cleaned up.  Yes. Because you kept [inaudible] tried to talk to you but –",teacher
What about this?,student
"Just hold on to it.  Excellent job.  Student K and Student K, I can see that you’re ready for lunch.  Excellent job, Student T and Student B for cleaning up. What’s the  problem?",teacher
[inaudible],student
Okay.,teacher
He’s on camera.,student
Just [inaudible] it’s okay.,teacher
[inaudible],student
Yes.  Student K’s going to come around and collect the bags. Make sure all of the chips and the cards are in the bag and then you can return to your seat. Right.  We’re a little late.,teacher
[inaudible],student
"Pretty good. Excellent job, Student N, for showing me that you’re ready. Excellent job, Student S and Student B.",teacher
Teacher?,student
