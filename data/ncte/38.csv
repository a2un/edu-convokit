"Okay.  So today we’re gonna do some work, talk about fractions. And I just want to review some of the work we’ve already done and talk about the generalizations that we know.  So we talked about when two fractions have the same denominator.  How do we compare them?",teacher,48,3,,,1.0

"Okay.  So you’re telling me if you take one – if you take two- thirds of the pizza or one-third of a pizza, you’re left with the other fraction.  Can someone explain to me – so that helps me to understand why you’re not equal.  Can someone – let’s go back to the original question.  When two fractions have the same denominator – and we’re comparing fractions, when they have the same denominator.  What do we know about them?  Which one is greater?  [Inaudible] put up here.  When do we carry fractions? So we’re comparing fractions.  I’ve got two fractions.  Can someone give me two fractions with the same denominator? Student B?",teacher,112,10,1.0,,0.0

So I don’t want to eat more than one slice, so this is my slice, okay?  I’m just gonna put a B there for Miss B.  Student B has been doing excellent, excellent work.

That’s okay.  We’re videotaping. Okay.  All right, thank you.  Okay.  We’re just going over some fractions.  So now I’m gonna go and ask you a second question.
