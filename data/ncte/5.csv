Okay.  This afternoon we’re going to be doing a lesson on –,teacher,12,0,,,0.0
Fractions.,student,1,1,,,
"Fractions, percent equivalents and we’ve been working on this and let’s see if I just say to you I’m going to give you a percent and I wanna see if you can give me the equivalent fraction.  All right.  So let’s see if you can.  Let’s see if you remember some of them.  Some of them are tough, as you know, the eighths and the sixths.  We’ve been working on that.  Okay.  Now, how about 75 percent?  What would be the fraction equivalent of that?  Student K?",teacher,87,8,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
Six-eights.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],multiple students,1,0,,,
Shh.  Shh.  Raise your hand please.  Three-fourths it would be equivalent to what fraction?,teacher,14,2,,,0.0
There’s two of them.,student,4,0,,,
Three-fourths would be equivalent to 70 so they’d be worth the same.  Correct?,teacher,13,1,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Student C?  Were you gonna say something?  Okay.  So what we’re going to be doing is comparing percents, fractions.  I got a tricky one for you, though, ’cause this is one that some of you get a little bit mixed up on, the one-eighth.  What would the percent be for one-eighth?  What would the percent be?",teacher,56,4,,,0.0
Twelve-and-a-half percent.,student,2,1,,,
Twelve-and-a-half percent.  Good.  And then how about one- sixth?  Student C?,teacher,11,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
What is it?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Percent.,student,1,1,,,
Percent.  Good.  Okay.  So those are – those are always the trickier ones.  Right.  How about five-tenths?,teacher,17,2,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
Student P?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
What is it?,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Fifty percent.,student,2,1,,,
"Fifty percent.  Okay.  Good.  Okay.  So we’re going to look at the objective up here and we are gonna be identifying fraction and percent equivalents through reasoning about representations and known equivalents and relationships and then we’re gonna play the in between game. – two students demonstrate playing it.  So we’re all gonna watch ’cause I wanna make sure that everybody knows how to play the game.  Okay.  So the first thing that we’re gonna take out would be our little fraction cards.  Do you have your fraction cards, the yellow [inaudible]?  Everybody’s got them.  Hopefully.  I thought that maybe we’d use the whole pack but I don’t think we will today because some of them on here are – the numerator’s bigger than the denominator.  We need to talk about that.  Okay.  So if you would just take out the cards with the diamonds and you’re gonna play with a partner and we’re gonna be seeing how well you know your percents and your fraction equivalents. We’re gonna see how good you’re going to be doing on this. Student A?",teacher,181,13,,,0.0
Can we [inaudible]?,student,3,0,,,
Excuse me?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
Can we choose our own partners?,student,6,0,,,
First we’re gonna do a demonstration and then we’re gonna all – I don’t know before we were doing all right with the partners that we chose before.  You want to maybe mix it up a little bit?,teacher,38,0,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Okay.  So what I’d like you to do is first take out all of your little fraction cards and you see the diamond on the side, just the diamond ones and then put the other ones in a safe place for later on when we talk about improper fractions when the numerator is bigger than the denominator.  We haven’t really quite got to that section yet.  So just take out the cards with the little diamond on the side.  Do you have your cards?  Okay.  Everybody’s got them, hopefully.  Okay.",teacher,91,4,,,0.0
I left mine at home.,student,5,0,,,
"Okay.  Then you’re gonna just have to watch, then, if you don’t have them.  Okay.  You may be – oh, no.  You know what? You can sit with somebody that has them.  Okay.  But they shouldn’t be at home.  They should be brought in.  Okay.",teacher,45,0,1.0,,0.0
I forgot them.,student,3,0,,,
"Okay.   All right.  Now, in addition to having – two of you play you really need one deck of cards, correct.  So now take out, if you would, the rules for the game.  You’ve got the rules for the in between game that I gave you last week when we were working on it.",teacher,54,1,,,0.0
So we gotta go in between?,student,6,0,,,
"And if you have the rules you might also have, please sit down. Pleas sit down.",teacher,16,0,0.0,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"Please sit down.  Please sit down, Student D.  You may also have your percent equivalent strip, too, that we worked on and we were right in the fractions, right below the percents.  You may have that also or you might have this one also.  That’s if you don’t know them still, you know, some of you may very well know them so – game it’s in your math handbook, okay, you have that so if you don’t have the rules but I think most of you know how to – kinda have a clue as to – we’re gonna do a demonstration on it anyway. Okay.  So everybody’s got all of those papers out.  What we will also need would be just a piece of scrap paper so that we’re gonna play five rounds of this game.  Okay.  And whoever – who’s gonna win the game?",teacher,146,4,,,0.0
Me.,student,1,0,,,
Who’s going to win the game?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0
Me.  [Inaudible.],multiple students,2,0,,,
When somebody –,teacher,3,0,,,0.0
Got the lowest –,student,4,0,,,
"Right.  Has the lowest number.  Right.  When somebody has the lowest number they will be the ones that win.  So you’ve got everything out that we need.  I – Student D, can you pass out a small piece of math paper to everybody?  So we’ll use this to, you know, mark rounds, one round, two rounds, three rounds, four rounds and five rounds and whoever wins is the winner.",teacher,69,0,,,0.0
We play five rounds?,student,4,0,,,
"We’re gonna play five rounds.  Yeah.  Okay.  So first though, I think before we even do anything what I’d like to do is have a little demonstration just to be sure that people remember.  There’s something on the floor, honey.  I don’t know if that’s one of the cards.  I don’t know.",teacher,52,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
Pardon me?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
The cards.,student,2,0,,,
Is somebody’s initials on that?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0

No?,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
I don’t think it’s mine.,student,5,0,,,
"Well, there should be initials on the back.  No.  Okay.",teacher,10,0,0.0,,0.0
"Yeah, I put all my initials [inaudible].",student,7,0,,,
"Okay.  So you know what?  We’re gonna – you  might have an extra piece of scrap paper.  That’s okay but I think first of all we’re gonna have Student D, I don’t know who owns it anyway.  Student D and Student A play a demonstration game for us.  Okay.  ’Cause they know how to play.  Who won last time with you two?",teacher,62,0,0.0,,0.0
Me.,student,1,0,,,
"You?  Okay.  So what we’re gonna do just for a couple of minutes is we’re gonna review playing the game to make sure everybody knows what to do.  If you don’t have the rules to the in-between game you need to take it out, okay and that –",teacher,48,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible?],student,1,0,,,
Excuse me?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"No, everybody can just have one and they could just, you know, go with – wit with another person, whoever we’re gonna play with.  But first of all I would like Student D.  I would like all of you kind of move your desks over so we can bring Student D up here and then Student A can come up. You don’t need to move too far, just so we have enough room to kinda stand around them as we put their desks in the middle.  So want to move over a little bit, please?  Move over so I want to bring Student D’s desk up here.",teacher,107,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
Huh?,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
Why can’t we just use everybody else –,student,8,0,,0.0,

Excuse me?,teacher,2,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"Student D, want to come up please?  And Student A bring a chair up, please and just come right here and then we’re just gonna stand.  Just bring a chair hon, you don’t need to bring the desk, okay.  Okay.  Good.  Come on up.  All right.  Now, the rest of you, Students, all of us we’re gonna be so good at this.  We’re gonna be so good.  Look at that, uh oh.  Uh oh.",teacher,74,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"Student A, come over here please and Student I, please, come on up.  Okay.  So come on over everybody.  Come on over. And especially if some of you don’t remember so the very – I would need everybody standing up so everybody can see what’s going on with these kids.  Okay.  So we are on round number one so could you please write round one on your paper anywhere and then put A and then D so we’re gonna see – we’re gonna do the first round.  Could someone loan him a pencil so he could write that.  Just write round one, okay. Student B, I need you too, honey.  Okay.  So we’re gonna do round one and whoever gets the lowest score after all five rounds will be a winner and I think since you did such a good job on Friday, since I’m bringing you in something tomorrow that maybe some of the winners today.  Student I won the spelling bee so you’re gonna get something else and then maybe the winners of this so come on over, honey, come on over and watch.  Okay. So let’s explain so the very first thing that we do, what do we do here?  What do we do?  Student A?",teacher,209,0,,,0.0
Shuffle the cards.,student,3,0,,,
"We shuffle the cards, just the ones with the diamonds on them, right?  And then in the middle of the desk what are we putting down?  Are we putting down fractions or percents?",teacher,33,2,,,0.0
Percents.,multiple students,1,1,,,
"Percents.  We put 10 percent over here, 50 percent in the middle and 90 percent over here.  First of all, who can tell me 10 percent stands for what fraction?  Who can tell me?  Student J?",teacher,36,6,,,0.0
Tenth.,student,1,1,,,

One-half.,student,1,0,,,
One-half.  And 90 percent stands for –,teacher,7,1,,,0.0
Nine-tenths.,student,1,1,,,
"Nine-tenths.  Very good.  Okay.  So first of all we put those out, right.  And then the next thing we’re going to do is we shuffle the cards around and you all – how much is each person going to get?  How many cards?",teacher,43,1,,,0.0
Six.,student,1,0,,,
"Six.  Okay.  So we mix them up.  Now, do you have six, Student A?  And you  have six, right?  Okay.  So now you’re gonna take turns placing the card so that it touches another card like this.  You also can put an equivalent – what does equivalent mean?",teacher,48,2,,,1.0
The same.,multiple students,2,0,,,
"The same.  Equivalent fraction right up above the percent. Right.  Or below, yeah.  Okay.  So the object of the game is to see how many cards you are going to place.  Okay. Now, as you put the card down, if you get one close to any of the percents that are down here you are going to say what the fraction is and its equivalent.  Okay.  I don’t know, Student C, I don’t know if we were doing that last time.  So anyway, okay, so who dealt the cards?  Did somebody – did you – he dealt them.  Okay.  Student A, take one of your cards out and then you have to state the fraction and the percent equivalent.",teacher,119,8,,,1.0
One ten and 10 percent.,student,5,1,,,

Could we put it in here?  No.  No.  We couldn’t.  And then we have one-eighth.  What would one-eighth stand for?,teacher,20,0,,,0.0
Twelve -and-a-half,multiple students,2,0,,,
"Twelve -and-a-half percent.  Could we put that in here?  It would go right here but once these cards are touching you can’t put anything in between. Okay.  So we just played one round.  They just played one round.  So how many cards do you have left, Student D?  Two.  So write two next to your initial.  And Student A has –",teacher,61,1,,,0.0

I don’t wanna play.,student,4,0,,,
Okay.  Okay.  So now we’re on round two and after five rounds whoever has the lowest amount are they the winner?  Are they the winner?,teacher,25,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Okay.  Okay.  Good so, you know, the whole object of this game is called in between which means once the cards are touching you can’t put anything in between them.  Okay.",teacher,31,1,,,0.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
"That’s why they’re called in between so then after we do the diamond ones then we’re gonna learn about improper fractions where the numerator is bigger than the denominator and then we’ll be able to play with that too. Okay. Okay.  So the first thing they did, what’d they do? Student K, what’d they do there?",teacher,56,3,,,1.0
[Inaudible.],student,1,0,,,
What did they put down there?,teacher,6,0,,,0.0

"Three-tens, 30 percent.",student,3,1,,,
"Okay.  Go ahead.  That’s a tricky one, huh? Show it up – hold it up to the rest of the kids and see if anybody – hold it up.  What is the fraction?",teacher,33,1,,,0.0

"No, 83 and-a-third.",student,3,0,,,
83 -and-a-third percent.  So can you put that down there?  No ’cause we’ve got 75 percent here and then 90 percent so we couldn’t put that in between.,teacher,28,3,,,0.0
Can’t put it in there. No.,student,6,0,,,
What’s that?  What percent is that?  Five-eights.,teacher,7,1,0.0,,0.0

Student D.,multiple students,2,0,,,
"Oh, gee.  Again.  Okay.  So why don’t you finish playing the rounds, okay, five rounds and then I’ll put people in partners and then we can switch around a little bit today. Okay.  But you really, really need to know how to play. Does everybody think that they can play it now?",teacher,52,0,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Is there anybody that still might have difficulty playing with this?  And some of you still don’t know the equivalent percent in fractions so that’s why it’s a good idea to keep that paper out to help you so that you learn them ’cause I will be giving you quizzes on this so that you know them perfectly.  Some of you still don’t know even your multiplication facts, as yet.  So that needs to be, you know, you need to be studying that, too, ’cause last time what did we have, five 100’s on that?  I think or six so we’ll be ready for that. Okay.  So let’s see.  Is there anybody here that would like to choose somebody rather than me doing it and everybody’s gonna have to play today.  Okay.  So let us see, Student M, who would you like to play with today?",teacher,146,4,,,1.0
Student A?,student,2,0,,,
Student A.  Okay.  So Student A just needs to move a chair over next to you and you just need one deck of cards and the piece of paper.  Okay?  Student J?,teacher,32,0,,,0.0
