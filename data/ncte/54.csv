"So, is a circle graph like fractions?  Divide ‘em into parts.",student,11,4,,0.0,
"Okay.  ‘Cause that goes – very good.  That goes with our central question.  We’re jumping ahead a little bit but that goes with our central question because the question that I had today was when can a circle graph be used in math?  So, Student A just said that a circle graph can be used when we’re doing fractions.  Does anybody know another way that we can use a circle graph?  He had his hand up. Student D?",teacher,78,7,1.0,,1.0
"You can use a circle graph, like if you put all the [Inaudible] teachers and kids and stuff into here, you can put ‘em in parts and then you could like put ‘em – you can do it like Student S had her answer.",student,44,2,,0.0,

You’re gonna have to come up with a number of how much they watch.",teacher,74,3,,,0.0

Watch TV.,student,2,0,,,
"They watch TV 43 percent of the world’s TV sets.  Okay?  All right.  So, we gotta figure out in this circle how 43 percent is gonna look.  So, what you could do, you know that this is half right?",teacher,39,3,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"You go across or if you go down, right?",teacher,9,0,,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,

We’re gonna draw a line.,student,5,1,,,
– when you draw 43 percent is it gonna look like half of the circle?,teacher,15,2,1.0,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No.  It’s not gonna look like half of the circle because 7 percent of it is missing.  So, 43 percent is kind of like a quarter of the circle.  Okay, ‘cause we got 50 percent here.  Let’s do it again.  50 percent.  I’m just doing a review.  And you know that we said that half of this is what?  25 percent.  Right?",teacher,62,8,,,0.0

Yes.,student,1,0,,,
To make it look like 43 percent.  So how would you do that on your circle graph?  I want to see you do it.,teacher,24,3,,,1.0
Ah.,student,1,0,,,

Would you say this is 43 percent?,teacher,7,1,0.0,,1.0

I still think that’s too big.   It’s much bigger than that.,teacher,11,0,,,0.0
