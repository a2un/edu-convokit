"Okay, so here’s the fraction track that we started with yesterday.  And some of you got started.  Can somebody explain how they knew either how to fill in blank dots or where to add dots.  Student F?",teacher,37,2,,,1.0
Because if those – if it was in the fourth thing you only knew – you already knew that there [inaudible] 50 and 75 [inaudible] and 100 [Indiscernible] single one of them so we didn’t have to guess that.,student,39,0,,1.0,
"You’re right.  So these are all marked as one whole, which we’re also going to change into fractions as we go.  So, it sounds like you looked at the one out of fourths first.  Is that what you had said?  This one? So you knew what about fourths?",teacher,48,2,0.0,,0.0
"That there was only four and there were only 25, 75 – I mean 25, 50, and 75 and 100 [inaudible] so you have to guess that one.",student,28,0,,0.0,
"Okay, so it sounds like you took the fractions and you changed them to what?",teacher,15,1,0.0,,0.0
"Twenty five, fifty –",student,4,0,,,
I don’t know what that means.  Can you explain that a little bit further?  Where did you get 25 from?,teacher,20,0,,,1.0
Is it recording or no?,student,5,0,,,
Uh-huh.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"It’s fine.  Don’t worry about the camera.  It’s just like a normal math day.  So, I liked what you said.  You know that it has 25, 50, and 75.  I’m just wondering where those numbers came from.",teacher,37,0,,,0.0
Twenty five [inaudible] I know where the [middle] –,student,9,0,,0.0,
But I wrote ¼.  I didn’t write 25.  So where are you getting 25 from?,teacher,15,0,1.0,,1.0
I know that one-fourth is 25.  I know that two-fourth is 50. And I know that three-fourth is 75.,student,19,0,,0.0,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
And I know [inaudible],student,4,0,,,
"Excellent.  You’re doing something, but you’re not explaining what you’re doing.  So you’re taking ¼ and you said you changed it to 25.  What does that mean that you changed it to 25?",teacher,33,0,,,1.0
I turned into a percent.,student,5,1,,,
"Okay, thank you.  That’s what I was looking for.  So you changed it 25 percent, right?  Very good.  That’s a big difference so you want to remember to say that.  So, how many of you did that.  How many of you took this fraction track and thought of it as percents?  I’m just curious. Just a few of you?  Okay, because we have been working on that a lot so I thought a lot of people might do that. Excellent job. So, let’s focus in on this one since Student F pointed it out.  Is there something that is missing --",teacher,101,3,1.0,,1.0

You shouldn’t look at the top.,student,6,0,,,
"Okay.  We had the very first halfway mark labeled for us. Student T, since you weren’t here you should be filling this in as you go.

The numerator.,student,2,1,,,
"The numerator. We are looking at the numerator or the part and we see it go zero- fourth, one-fourth two-fourth, three-fourth one.  How could we change that to help us know that we really are correct? Student J?",teacher,38,2,,,1.0
The four-fourth.,student,2,0,,,
"The four-fourth, good.  So I’m just going to put that in parenthesis to check my work.  You could do that, too, if you want to check your work.  It’s up to you.  Can somebody choose another track for us to finish off?  Student T?",teacher,44,0,,,0.0
We finish off the – six – I meant the eighths.,student,11,0,,0.0,
The eighths.,teacher,2,0,1.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, very good.  So the eighths are a little more confusing, but we did learn a lot of the equivalent fractions.  So are there any fractions in the eighths that we know are equal to another fraction that might be already labeled on the chart?  It’s kind of a tricky question.  But I always think of that yummy chocolate bar that I let you guys eat, and remember it was broken up into four pieces? And then we had to make eight pieces out of it, and what did you do? Student B?",teacher,93,3,,,0.0
We broke it in half.,student,5,0,,,

Two-eighths.,student,1,0,,,
Two-eighths is equal to?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
One-fourth.,student,1,0,,,

Yes.,student,1,0,,,
There’s another one or a couple more for the eighths that are equal to something else.  Does anybody know another fraction out of eight that is equal to something else on the chart?  Student J?,teacher,35,1,,,1.0
Four-eights.,student,1,0,,,
Four-eights is equal to ½.  So that’s what I’m going to do. What’s the problem back there?,teacher,17,0,,,0.0
I don’t get this.,student,4,0,,,
"So you did miss yesterday’s lesson so I will help you.  Just as a reminder, you might have missed yesterday; these are just like number lines. Do you remember how we worked on the fractions with the number line? So, each line is a number line.  This one is broken up into halves.  This one is going to be broken up into thirds, although it’s not complete, but if you look at this one, we finished this one.  So it’s just like a number line where we have lines to break them up.",teacher,93,7,,,0.0

One-half.,student,1,0,,,
"One-half.  So that’s where I was lining them up, making sure that they’re lined up as best as I can.  It’s not going to be perfect. The important part is that you’re using the skills that you know because we know it’s not going to be perfect.  None of us are.  Right?",teacher,52,1,,,0.0

Sixth-eighth is also three-fourth.,student,4,0,,,

If you haven’t finished then I will give you time in a little bit.  I see a card already on the floor over there. So I have these little like – they’re kind of like post-its because I don’t – if I put a chip on the board – on my board what’s going to happen?",teacher,86,0,,,0.0
It’s going to fall.,student,4,0,,,
It’s going to fall down.  So I’m using a post-it.  But we’re going to read the directions and play on this board to practice and then you’ll get to play as a team at your table.  We have 30 minutes before lunch.  So we should only have to spend five minutes practicing the game and then you should get about 20 minutes in order to play with a partner.  How much time does that leave us? Student D?,teacher,78,0,,,0.0

Exactly.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay?  Because it’s one whole and three-fourths is less than one whole.  Very good, Student T.  So, we have to put it somewhere less than three-fourths, anywhere on the board but less than three-fourths.  So, where is one place that I could put a chip?  Student J?",teacher,47,2,,,0.0

Does anyone know what two-fifths is equal to, either from looking at your fraction charge or just because you have it memorized?  Student K?",teacher,87,1,,,1.0
