"Here we go.  Alright boys and girls. Today – on Friday we talked about fractions a little bit, right?  Let’s take a look at the everyday counts board right here to the right. Who can – and I’ve added a couple of things to it.  So tell me something you see on the board, anything we talked about, something new; whatever you want to add.  Student M.",teacher,67,2,,,0.0
Well I see at the bottom that you added the graph and you cut them into four pieces.,student,18,1,,0.0,
Okay.  Do you want to come up and show me which one you’re talking about honey?,teacher,16,0,0.0,,0.0
Four equal pieces.,student,3,0,,,
Four equal pieces.  So what does that mean?,teacher,8,0,,,1.0
It means it’s a fraction.,student,5,1,,,
"Okay, it’s a fraction.  What would you call those fractions?",teacher,10,2,1.0,,1.0
Fourths?,student,1,0,,,
Fourths.  Why?,teacher,2,0,,,1.0
Because there’s actually four equal pieces.,student,6,0,,,
Very good.  Anyone want to add to that? Student C.  Do you want to add to anything she said about the four pieces or do you want to talk about something else?,teacher,32,2,1.0,,1.0
"The four pieces, I know that the decimal is going to be fixed.",student,13,1,,0.0,
How do you say that decimal?,teacher,6,1,1.0,,1.0

That’s a percent.  How do you say it as a decimal?  Yes.,teacher,12,2,1.0,,1.0
Oh.,student,1,0,,,
"25 hundredths.  Remember boys and girls, the place value chart here, you got the point four zero, right?  See the zero up here?  It’s hundredths.  Look at point two five.  The five is in the hundredths place.  So it’s 25 hundredths.  Thank you.  Back to Student C.  What else did you want to say?",teacher,54,5,,,1.0
And I know that you can put the 25 because –,student,11,0,,1.0,
Because why?  Good.  Why do – why is it 25 hundredths?  What does that mean?,teacher,15,1,1.0,,1.0
Because 25 could go – because four quarters equals 25 –,student,11,1,,1.0,
Out of what honey?,teacher,4,0,0.0,,0.0

"Hm.  What do you think about that Student [S]?  Let’s go to the board for a minute.  I’ve got to get a black marker.  Let’s figure out – ‘cause it is confusing and that’s what this is all about is what are fractions and the three different ways we say them.  So we have a fraction.  Student J, one fraction is – you outlined, what was it?",teacher,67,4,,,1.0
One-fourth.,student,1,0,,,

I think it’s 65 out of 100.,student,7,0,,,
"That’s true, but alright; I’m confusing you.  I showed this model because we’ve been doing this for everyday counts, right?  When we colored in one square, how much was that as a fraction?  One out of –",teacher,37,2,1.0,,0.0

Can I sit next to him?,student,6,0,,,
"Yes. And let’s take a look at these directions together, okay?  Pencils are down.  Eyes on the board.  I really – I am gonna collect this and it does count.  It’s the beginning of fractions, but you’ve already prepared.  It took a little preparation for this, right?  You made your fraction walls. Student J, do I have your attention?  Student L, do I have your attention?  Pencils down please.  You can put your name on it in a minute, okay?  Okay, everybody’s ready?  Alright. Then you have and obviously have – I’ll just read it up here.  Your objective to find as many fraction equivalents as you can using your fraction wall as you all have.  So your eyes are up here or on your paper as I’m reading and going over the directions, right?  Okay. Find as many fraction equivalents as you can using the fourths, eighths and sixteenths fraction wall – that’s the one I asked you to take out – and to release five fraction equivalents and prove your answers by tracing your fraction pieces to show that they are equal in size.  Record your work neatly on a separate paper. And I meant, of course, to talk about equivalents and I got sidetracked.  That’s what you all were showing me weren’t you?  You were saying a fourth gives me two-eighths if I cut it in half.  They are – where’s my equivalent – equivalent, right?  They’re the same size, but what’s different about them, Student J?  Equivalent fractions, they take up, like Student S said, they’re the same size but what’s different?",teacher,266,15,1.0,,0.0

Two-fourths?,student,1,0,,,
"Two-fourths.  So two-fourths is equivalent to one-half, right? Excellent.  Alright. So I gave an example on your paper. It says, for example –  I, of course, gave you an easy one and I traced the one-half, right?  And I put the one-fourth right under it and I traced it.  And then I wrote the expression: one-half equals two-fourths.  That’s what I want you to do.  I want you to do five of those.  That’s why you got two pieces of paper because it’s gonna take up some space, isn’t it?",teacher,90,2,,,0.0
Mm hm.,multiple students,2,0,,,
"Now, could I do something that’s equal to three-fourths? Absolutely.  Could I do something that’s equal to six- eighths or eight-sixteenths?  Do you understand?  It doesn’t have to be one-fourth equals this.  It could be three-fourths is the same size as this many sixteenths or, you know, five-eighths is the same size as how many fourths or whatever.  Do you understand? So I would like you, with your partner – okay?  You’re gonna trace them on your own paper.  You can do the same ones or you can show each other.  So you’ll take your fraction wall – can I borrow your fraction.  Alright? And I’m gonna say, okay well, here’s a fourth.  Hm, here’s three- fourths.  Three-fourths is the same size as – and then I’m gonna start lining up my sixteenths to figure out exactly how many sixteenths are gonna line up to equal the same as fourths.  Does that make sense?

"If it’s equivalent, if it doesn’t line up perfectly?  No.  So you wouldn’t be able to do it.  And it’s true.  Not everything has an equivalent on this chart.  Okay? Alright?  So five of those. If you finish, you go on to the next fraction wall on the bottom. Now, you’ve got your thirds, your sixths, your twelfths. We are gonna do this.  We’ll do this tomorrow if we don’t get to it today.  Now you’re gonna combine all of them. Your sixths and your eighths and your twelfths and see, maybe there’s a certain amount of thirds that go into twelfths or fourths that go into twelfths, right; or sixths or fifteenths.  And you’ll start to combine those.  But we’re just gonna start with fourths, eighths and sixteenths today.  Alright? So go ahead and get busy.  We’ve got about fifteen minutes. What is that?

Yeah. Yes.,student,2,0,,,
"What would you write?  Alright, boys and girls, just like on your paper, you have to write the expression.  I wrote one- half equals two-fourths, right?  You write that and you draw the picture, right?  You trace it.  So what would yours say?",teacher,43,1,,,1.0
One whole equals two?,student,4,1,,,
"Two-halves.  Two over two.  So over here, you’re gonna trace this, right?  So you’d write one whole equals two out of two.  And then you trace those.   Are you all doing the same one? You’re supposed to be working with Student T and he’s doing the same thing?",teacher,48,1,,,0.0

So let’s start at the top of the paper. Right?  Up here.  Why are you way down there?  Okay? I will put more blue paper over here if you need it. Did you guys only get one each?  You too?  How about you Student M? If you’re waiting for your partner, fool around with the pieces and see if you can find a more interesting one.  Don’t forget, you have sixteenths.

"Yes you do have sixteenths. I want fractions.  Fourth; that’s not a fraction.  You’re not incorrect Student E; you’re correct but equivalent.  If you look at the paper – I don’t have times two or any – I just say one-half equals two- fourths, although you’re very correct in what you put there.  The way I’ve got to do that but, for right now, I want to see the equation.  I want to see the expression, okay?  And especially Student B, she needs to see that.
