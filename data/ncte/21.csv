"Okay, boys and girls, so tomorrow for math we are actually going to be playing a game using our fraction tracks game board that Student Y is passing out right now.  Our goal today is, we are going to be completing this game board. So we need to take our prior knowledge about percents and equivalent fractions and we’re going to apply them today and complete this game board, so that tomorrow we can play the game successfully.  But it is extremely important that we are accurate on this game board in labeling all of our fractions.  If we’re not accurate, then tomorrow when we go to play the game it will not be very successful.  So everybody should have a copy of this fraction tracts game board sheet. Now I know we’re having some difficulties with our projector screen, so I will put it on the blackboard.  If you can’t see it, it is okay, you have one in front of you. And we will be discussing and doing some of this together, then you’ll be on your own working with your partners to complete the game board.  So if you cannot see the overhead board, that’s fine, just use the one that you have in front of you.  Okay? So now everybody has a game board in front of them.  Take a minute.  Look it over.  What do you notice? Think about it? Give you a minute, then we’ll raise our hands to answer. What do you notice about this game board? Are there any similarities to any other resources that we have created? Just give yourself a minute. Does anybody want to share with me what they notice about this game board? Student G?",teacher,287,5,,,0.0
They all will add up to a whole.,student,8,2,,1.0,
So all the pieces will add up to a whole.  Good.  What other similarities do we notice? Student I?,teacher,19,2,1.0,,1.0
"You know the thing that we did earlier in the unit, it was like this but it was a little longer, and we put in the equivalent fractions of different…",student,30,2,,0.0,
So I think it was page 10 where we did a percent fraction equivalent chart.  This looks a little bit similar to that. Keep that in the back of your mind when you’re filling this out.  What else does it look like? It looks like a bunch of these all on one game board.  Student T?,teacher,56,3,1.0,,1.0
I think the goal is just to get to one whole.,student,11,1,,0.0,
"Right, so you’re going to start at zero and we’re going to get to one whole.  Which means -- what does this look like? So look at the top one.  What does that look like? Student D?",teacher,37,1,1.0,,1.0
Two halves.,student,2,0,,,
"Two halves, but does it kind of look like a number line?",teacher,12,1,,,0.0
This is what I was talking about.,student,7,0,,,
"Oh, the percent strips, that’s another one that we can use, because we’ve made a bunch of resources so far in this unit that could help us be successful on this game board.  But doesn’t it look like this game board is full of number lines? And that’s exactly what these are.  But we’re going to call them today, fraction tracks, because that’s the name of the game that we’re going to be playing tomorrow. Okay? So if you look, we have a fraction track for halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths, eighths, and tenths.  Does everybody see that? So what we’re going to do now is, we are going to go over the first one, the fraction track for halves.  And today you have a couple supplies that you can use. You will be able to use a small ruler and your pencil.  And what I’m going to do now is, I’m going to put this on the overhead and we’re going to talk about the halves, and we’re going to do a couple of them together, and we’re going to see what we notice.  Then we are going to use our strategies and we’re going to work with our partners to fill them out. Okay.  So remember, if you cannot see this board, and I know it’s difficult because we are having some difficulties with our overhead screen. So look at the top fraction track, and it is representing halves.  So you’re starting on the left-hand size, zero halves.  Okay? And I’m going to show you something using this ruler.  If I use this ruler, and everybody follow along with me, and I put it right on that one-half mark that’s already marked for me. Does everybody see that? Go ahead and do it on your own game board. So one-half is already identified for us on the game board. Are there any other fraction tracks that have one-half already marked?",teacher,322,12,0.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
No? Look on the game board.  Raise your hand.  What fraction track has another stop halfway through? Student K?,teacher,19,1,,,0.0
"Umm, I don’t get that.",student,5,0,,,
"Okay, Student D?",teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
Five-tenths.,student,1,1,,,
"Okay, so we’re going to say that the tenths fraction tract has a stop halfway through on its track.  Okay? And, good job, he even told me what I need to be labeling that. So here we have – and I’m just going to do this because some of us are – one half.  So Student D, what did you say I’m going to name that other stop?",teacher,68,2,,,0.0
Five-tenths.,student,1,1,,,
Five-tenths.  And how did you know it was going to be five- tenths.,teacher,13,2,,,1.0
Because [inaudible].,student,2,0,,,
"Right, but let’s say, let’s talk about the tenths track, and we know that it’s halfway, right? So what do we know about tenths and halves?",teacher,26,2,,,0.0
Five-tenths is one-half.,student,3,1,,,
"So five-tenths would be equivalent to one-half, right? Because now we’re talking about the tenths track.  We know that with our ruler lined up, that we have a stop halfway through.  And Student D knew that five-tenths was equivalent to one-half, so that is how he figured that one out.  Okay? [0:07:00] Now, let’s put our rulers back on, now we have one-half and five- tenths.  Maybe just a little bit to the left so we can see our markings already.  Are there any other fraction tracks that we can use this line to put our stops on? Are there any other fraction tracks that we can use this line? Student Y, do you want to name one?",teacher,118,13,,,1.0
Three-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
"Three-sixths, good.  So everybody go to their sixths fraction track.  Now this is where the ruler part comes into play. Because remember I said that if it’s not an accurate game board, then tomorrow when we go to play our game it’s not going to be accurate.  So this is where you move your ruler so that you’re lined up with those two fractions, and then you find your sixths track and you draw a dot.  So that’s your stop.  And then we have three-sixths. And how did you know three-sixths was one of them, Student Y? How did you know that three-sixths would be one?",teacher,106,5,,,1.0
Because I know that three-sixths is equivalent to one-half in fractions.,student,11,2,,1.0,
"Perfect.  So, so far, we have three equivalent fractions. Let’s put our ruler back.  Are there any other fraction tracks that we could fill in a stop half way? Student K?",teacher,31,3,1.0,,0.0
"Here, I could put two-fourths.",student,5,0,,,
"Good, so let’s everybody now go to our fourths fraction track and let’s put a stop here and label that two-fourths.  Is there any other fraction tracks that need a stop halfway? Student J?",teacher,34,2,1.0,,0.0
Four-eighths.,student,1,0,,,
"Good.  So we need to go to the eighths fraction track.  We need to line up our ruler, draw our stop in, and label it, four- eighths.  Right? Okay, good.  So now, are there any others before I move on? Are there any other fraction tracks that need a stop halfway? Student K?",teacher,53,4,,,0.0
Two-tenths?,student,1,1,,,
"Two-tenths, would that be equivalent to one-half?",teacher,7,2,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"So we already did the one on the tenths fraction track, remember? The stop was already there for us.  All we had to do was identify it.  Okay? And that’s what we’re going to be doing today, is we’re going to make sure that each fraction track has the appropriate stops on its track. And, we’re going to use the ruler another way. So let’s just look at the half track, the first one up there. So that’s all we need to worry about right now.  What is a way we can double-check with our ruler? So I put the ruler vertically this way to double-check to see that they were all lined up, all the fractions that are equivalent to a half, okay? Yes, Student J?",teacher,127,10,,,0.0
"If you really lined up, it’s not exactly right there.",student,10,1,,0.0,
"As long as it’s close enough for us to play our game.  But it does have to be pretty accurate for tomorrow’s game.  Okay? Now, let’s look at the half fraction track.  Is that track completed? Does it have all the stops on this track, the half?",teacher,47,1,0.0,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Just this top track, this first one right here.  Do I need to add any other stops on? And what I want you to think of, it’s called fraction tracks, so think of a train track.  So you’re on the half train.  You start off at zero halves, that’s the starting point. That’s where you get on and board.  Then, what is your first stop going to be, Student I? What is the first stop on that track? The half track.  If you get on your train and you board at zero halves, what stop is the train going to make next?",teacher,102,2,,,0.0
Half.,student,1,0,,,
"So this train is on its route and it stops here.  That’s its first stop.  Some people might board, some people might get off, but then it continues on.  What’s the next stop on this track? Student T?",teacher,38,0,,,0.0
A whole.,student,2,1,,,
"A whole, two halves.  Did I miss any stops?",teacher,9,1,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"No.  Right? But what I want to double-check is to make sure that my stops are accurate. So everybody take their rulers now, everybody take their rulers and we’re going to measure.  And what should we notice? Let’s think about it.  Let’s make a prediction. What do you think the distance from zero halves to one-half is going to be? Student K? Let’s make a prediction.  How far do you think this first stop will be from zero halves to one half? Student T?",teacher,84,4,,,0.0
"It’s a half, or it could be called 50 percent.",student,10,1,,0.0,
"Okay, but do you think it’s going to be the same amount as it will be from one-half to one-whole?",teacher,20,1,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"Right.  And that’s where this ruler comes in, and that’s where our double-checking will come into play. So everybody take their rulers now.  How many inches is it from zero halves to one-half? Hands up.",teacher,35,2,,,0.0
In inches or …,student,4,0,,,
Let’s do inches.  Student C?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Four.,student,1,0,,,
"Four.  Now, Student C, let’s double-check the next stop.  Is it four inches from one-half to one-whole?",teacher,17,1,,,0.0
"Yes, it is.",student,3,0,,,
"Right.  So then Student C would say, “I have successfully finished this fraction track.”  Then, up here if you see on the white board, I’ve labeled to make it easier for you so we don’t forget any, all the fractions that need to be on this track.  So Miss H could say, “This track is done.” Then I would move on to my next track, to the thirds track. So this is kind of your guidance to make sure you don’t forget any stops, okay? So the next step is you’re going to go down to the thirds track, and this is where you’re going to work with your partners. Make sure that from each space in between zero thirds to one-third is the same, one-third to two-thirds, then two- thirds to three-thirds are all equal.  Also, don’t forget, some of them are already marked on there for you.  So some of the stops are already there.  And use what you know of the equivalent percents in fractions to help you fill in more than one at a time, just like we did with the halves. We knew that one-half was also equal to two-fourths, three- sixths, four-eighths and five-tenths.  So when we were filling out our half stop, we could fill out other ones as well.  So use what you know of equivalent percents in fractions to help you out.  Okay? So now what you’re going to be doing, Student A, is you’re going to be working with your table partner to fill in the rest of your tracks. Make sure you use your ruler and your background knowledge, okay? I will be coming around to each group to check to make sure you’re on the right track, okay? Also, be ready to share some of your strategies on how you filled out this fraction track.  Come on girls, how come you don’t have those filled out? We did those together. So did you double-check and measure?",teacher,328,12,,,0.0
"Yeah, the way we did the first one is we measured the distance in here and it was … 7 centimeters. Yeah, 7 centimeters.  And then we did the same thing over here and it was 7 centimeters.",student,38,5,,0.0,
"Okay, and was it 7 centimeters also between one-third and two- thirds?",teacher,12,1,1.0,,0.0
Uh-huh.  That’s why we put 7 centimeters.  See? That’s 7 centimeters.  And then you go over here and it’s 7 centimeters.,student,21,3,,0.0,
"Good, all right.",teacher,3,0,0.0,,0.0
These ones are confusing.,student,4,0,,,
"Okay, so the next one you’re going to do is the thirds track, right? So looking at our fraction here, how many equal groups do we need to break this track into? How many stops are we going to have?",teacher,40,2,,,0.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
Right.  And what told us that?,teacher,6,0,,,1.0
"Because one stop here, one stop here, and one stop here.",student,11,0,,1.0,
"Okay, so what tells us how many groups we’re going to have in total?",teacher,14,1,0.0,,1.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
What’s telling us that?,teacher,4,0,,,1.0
The first one.,student,3,0,,,
"Look at this fraction, what tells you.  Zero tells you how many stops there are going to be?",teacher,18,1,,,0.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
"Three.  Because remember, the denominator tells you how many groups you’re going to have altogether, right? So we know that this track is going to have three stops.  So far we only have one stop, from here to here, so we need to add in the next stop.  So we need to figure out where we’re going to put one-third, right? So what could you measure on here that would help tell you the measurement for the next stop? Because each stop has to be what?",teacher,86,4,,,0.0
Four inches?,student,2,0,,,
It doesn’t have to be four inches.  That was on the halves one. But what did you know about each stop? This was four inches and this was four inches.  So they need to be what?,teacher,36,0,,,0.0
Eight inches.,student,2,0,,,
No.,teacher,1,0,,,0.0
It needs to be three.,student,5,0,,,
"It needs to be equal.  Each stop needs to be the equal amount. Now, this measurement is going to be the same for any other one.  Okay? But what you need to know is that each stop on this track is going to be equal.  Okay? So is there already a stop on this track?",teacher,55,1,1.0,,0.0
Yes.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, so maybe let’s try and measure that stop to see if that helps us out.  You can use inches if that’s what you feel more comfortable with. So you line it up.",teacher,33,2,,,0.0
It would be close to three.,student,6,0,,,
"Here.  So now, where can you measure out the first stop? Good, so now where are you going to put the first stop?",teacher,23,1,0.0,,0.0
Right here.,student,2,0,,,
Good.  And you’re going to label it what?,teacher,8,0,,,0.0
One-third.,student,1,0,,,
"Good.  So use your ruler, because remember we need to be accurate so that tomorrow when we go to play the game… Now, let’s measure to double-check to see if this is the same amount, and then we know all of our stops are correct.",teacher,45,2,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
Is it close enough?,teacher,4,0,,,0.0
Close.,student,1,0,,,
"Okay, now let’s do that vertical trick that I taught you.  What is one-third also equal to?",teacher,17,1,,,0.0
One third is equal to two-sixths.,student,6,0,,,
"Good.  So is there already a two-sixths on this game board? So could we have just taken our ruler, lined it up vertically to two-sixths, right? Okay.  So those are the two strategies that you can use.  Use your measurement, or use what you know about the other equivalent fractions that are already on the game board to help you out.  Did you need help?",teacher,65,5,1.0,,0.0
Somebody erased it.,student,3,0,,,
"Well those are all just on the left-hand side, the zeroes, those are just the starting points.  This is good, you got this track done.  But two-fourths wouldn’t go here because two-fourths is equivalent to what fraction?",teacher,37,2,,,0.0
One-half.,student,1,0,,,
Right.  So remember I showed you this on the board.  One-half is already here for you.  So use what you already have and use what you know to make this easier for you.,teacher,33,0,,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"I can turn it a little bit for you but that’s it.  Okay, no, this has to stay here.  If you want to swivel your chair so that your back is against the sun, that’s fine.  So then what is this? They’ve already given you the stop, all you need to do is name that stop.  So if this is the fourths track, what are we missing here?",teacher,68,0,,,0.0
The thirds.,student,2,0,,,
Right.  So that’s equivalent to what fraction?,teacher,7,2,,,0.0
Three-fifths?,student,1,0,,,
"So let’s look at the fifths track.  There’s one, two, three would be about here, does that fall on that line?",teacher,21,1,,,0.0
Four-eighths.,student,1,0,,,
"If I had five pies and I tried to divide them in half, could I do it?",teacher,17,1,,,0.0
Four-eighths is…,student,2,0,,,
"Right, but listen to me, if I had five pies and I wanted to divide them equally among two friends, could I do it?",teacher,24,1,,,0.0
No.,student,1,0,,,
"No.  So, four-eighths is one of them, we’ve already done this. You should already have this on your track board, your game board.  What is another fraction? Where’s your pencil? Come on, Student K, we need to stay focused here.  That’s fine. I’ll get you an eraser, but let’s stay focused.  So put your four-eighths on the game board.  That was nice of you, thank you.  Use your ruler to line it up is what I’m saying, Student K.  Keep yourself organized.  Good.  Write four-eighths. What else is equal to one-half on here?",teacher,93,3,,,0.0
Five-tenths is already there.,student,4,1,,,
Right.  Four-eighths is already there.,teacher,5,0,,,0.0
Three-sixths is down here.,student,4,0,,,
"You have it on the board, but is it placed right?",teacher,11,0,,,0.0
Nope.,student,1,0,,,
"Nope, if it’s equivalent to one-half it’s going to fall where?",teacher,11,1,,,0.0
Right here.,student,2,0,,,
"Good.  Okay, so now you have your halves.  Student B, I’ll be right with you, but I want you to keep working. Okay, good.  So now, look, you’re almost done with this track.  You just need to add what?",teacher,39,1,,,0.0
Three-fourths.,student,1,0,,,
"Thank you.  All right.  Stay focused.  Student J, did you need me? Nope, you’re all set?",teacher,16,0,,,0.0
I just noticed that it makes a few [inaudible].,student,9,0,,1.0,
"Cool.  All right.  All right, I’m coming.",teacher,7,0,0.0,,0.0
"I know we can’t measure it one-fourth because that’s half, and since it was three, I thought weren’t we supposed to measure it in [inaudible] to three?",student,27,2,,1.0,
"Well, no.  You’re supposed to have how many equal groups? So how many stops is the third track going to have?",teacher,21,1,0.0,,0.0
Three.,student,1,0,,,
"Three, right.  So you already have one stop here, right? So we need to find where the other stop is going to be.",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
Right there.,student,2,0,,,
"Well, let me ask you this question: Are there any other fractions already put on this game board that are equivalent to one-third that could help you out, like one- half was?",teacher,32,2,,,1.0
This could – well wait.,student,5,0,,,
"We’re over here, for one-third.  Are there any other fractions on this game board that could help you that are equivalent to one-third?",teacher,23,2,0.0,,1.0
"We can use one-fourth, because if one-fourth goes there, all you have to do is…",student,15,0,,0.0,
"Even though it would be a little bit away, but remember, we’re trying to be really accurate.  So listen to what I’m asking you.  Are there any other fractions on this game board that are equivalent to one-third that could help us out?",teacher,43,2,1.0,,1.0
Equivalent to one-third?,student,3,1,,,
"Mm-hmm, equal to. Remember, what’s in the thirds family? Thirds and what are in the same family?",teacher,17,0,,,0.0
Two-thirds?,student,1,0,,,
"Well, the thirds family, what other family is related to the thirds family?",teacher,13,0,,,1.0
Sixths?,student,1,0,,,
"The sixths family, remember? So what fraction in the sixths family is equivalent to one-third?",teacher,15,2,,,0.0
Two-sixths.,student,1,0,,,
"Two-sixths, good.  So is there already a two-sixths for us on the board? So all we would have to do is just line it up. That’s why it’s important to know your equivalent fractions, because they already had one on there that gave you the answer, okay? So let’s fill it in. Okay, a couple more minutes and we’re going to share our strategies, okay? So it looks like you guys have the fourths done.  You don’t have all of the sixths done, so why don’t we finish that track before we move on to the eighths?",teacher,97,2,,,0.0
We still didn't finish the one-thirds.,student,6,0,,,
So how can we make sure that all of these are with the same distance apart?,teacher,16,1,0.0,,0.0
But the middle group I don’t think is going to be small enough equal to this.,student,16,0,,0.0,
"Student G, you have work to do.  Are you almost done? Good, I’ll be right with you then.  All right, so you guys look like you’re doing pretty good and you just need to finish up the fifths and the eighths track.  So I don’t want you marking up this board too much, remember, this is going to be a game board for you to play a game tomorrow. Okay, well here you’re getting into improper fractions, okay? Look, we’re only going up to one whole so you put all of these in the right places but we don’t need these extra fractions here because this is past a whole.  When the whole is our last stop on the track.  So here you’re creating all those improper fractions.  So I just need you to go through and erase these, and other than that…  This is one-fourth.  So erase the extra ones that you don’t need in there, okay, because it’s going to screw you up tomorrow for your game.",teacher,169,6,0.0,,0.0
[Inaudible],student,1,0,,,
"Well, two-fourths is equal to what fraction?",teacher,7,1,,,0.0
"3, 33.",student,2,0,,,
"No, what other fraction on this game board is two-fourths equal to?",teacher,12,1,,,0.0
One-half.,student,1,0,,,
"One-half.  So this two-fourths needs to be directly under one- half. So where you have already put in four-fourths, that’s where two- fourths needs to go, okay? Okay, what did I say Student K when you’re done.",teacher,37,0,,,0.0
This one.,student,2,0,,,
"Okay, so don’t worry about that right now, we’re going to continue on to this now, okay? All right, so boys and girls, let’s reconvene and let’s talk about the different strategies that helped us place all of the rest of the fractions on our game board.  Does anyone have a strategy that they used that was really helpful? Student S? [0:32:00]",teacher,62,1,,,1.0
"Well, first I put in all the fractions that I knew were equivalent to something else.",student,16,2,,0.0,
"Oh good, so I really like that strategy, and that was one we talked about earlier.  Student S said she looked at the fractions that were already given to her on her game board, and then she filled in all the other fractions that she knew were equivalent to those.  So she used her knowledge of equivalent fractions to help fill out the game board. And then was it easier to fill in the ones that were still missing?",teacher,79,4,1.0,,0.0
"Yes, because it’s the same distance to go from one fraction to another.  I just marked it with the ruler and I just did the same distance for the fraction.",student,30,5,,1.0,
"Very good, very good strategies.  And Student I and T, what did you gals use?",teacher,15,0,0.0,,1.0
"After we did one thing, we [inaudible]…",student,7,0,,,
Speak up a little bit.  Who’s not listening to Student I’s strategy? Because some of you might have had he same strategy and it might be interesting to see how they did it as well.,teacher,35,0,0.0,,1.0
"We took a ruler and we measured two-thirds to one-whole, and whatever inches or centimeters that was, we [inaudible] we found the place we had measure, and whatever centimeters or inches [inaudible] was found where that was going to go.",student,40,6,,0.0,
"Good, so they took their knowledge of knowing that in between each stop on a certain track it was going to be equal in length, just like we did up here with the halves.  We knew that each stop had to be equal, and it equaled four inches. Student C, please give that back to him. So let me just use your paper for a second.  So what Tina did and Infinity did is they then looked at the thirds track, and they knew that there was already one stop put on there for them.  So they took their ruler and they measured it, finding out that it was 7 centimeters, okay? So then they knew from their starting point, they knew where to put one-third, because they knew it would be 7 centimeters. Because every stop on the thirds track had to be equal distance.  Okay? So that’s another good strategy.  We have using the distance and using our knowledge about equivalent fractions.  Were there any other strategies?",teacher,169,8,1.0,,0.0
"Well, we sort of did the same thing that they did.",student,11,0,,0.0,
"Okay, well those are two really, really good strategies.  So this will allow us now tomorrow …",teacher,17,0,1.0,,0.0
I think like…,student,3,0,,,
"Guys, I’m losing focus and I’m losing it.  Let’s hold it together, we only have a couple more minutes. So this will allow us, girls, tomorrow, to have our game board.  Did you ever think that you’d be able to create a game board by using equivalent fractions? No.  But tomorrow we’ll see how your knowledge had helped set up a game board for us to play a game, okay? All right, good job.",teacher,74,1,,,0.0
