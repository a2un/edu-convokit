"Okay, now, today’s focus on our lesson, boys and girls, is going to be on – if you look at our goal, it’s written on the board, and please do that right now.  And you should be turning to Page 1 in your workbook – is we’re going to describe three-dimensional solids using their attributes or properties.  Now that’s a big word, Student S, attributes or properties, but I’ll break it down for you.  Sit down. Okay, you’re not doing that right now, please. So basically what we’re going to be doing is you’re going to be describing these shapes to other people.  So what you’re going to do – and you’re gonna be in a group and you’re gonna get a bag.

Now, in this bag are all the solids that are on your paper, and this is our activity today. So we want to be able to describe these solids, but for right now we’re not gonna use these names.  So if I say this is called – if you see this on your paper, can someone tell me what it’s called on your paper?  Oh, good hands up. Student T?",teacher,122,0,,,1.0

"So we’re gonna talk a little bit about more why this is called a square prism and the other one’s called a rectangular prism.  Technically, you could call this a rectangular prism because a square is a rectangle, but we’re gonna – we’re not gonna worry about the names.  Student K, it’s not gonna help you if you just remember names of 3-D shapes. It’s really not gonna help you.  What’s gonna help you to start to understand the characteristics of them.  What – how can we describe them.  So like Student T started to say, this one looks rectangular or this one has a square.

You two are gonna be my guessers, you and you.  Okay, I’m the person with the bag. I reach my hand here.  I do not pull out a shape.  I take the shape in my hand and I start to feel around and I want to start describing it.  The words I use to describe it, Student L describes.  He’s gonna write down those words. Students J and A have their paper in front of them. They’re gonna try and guess using the paper they have in front of them.  Okay so ready … I’m gonna start.  Student L, he’s reporting.

"Before we start, before we start, I want to go back to our goal.  Our goals of today are not just to play a game.  Our goals of today are to begin to understand what the attributes or properties of of these different shapes.  So obviously, if we think about what Student L just described the cylinder, the cylinder has different properties.  It is rounded.  It is not flat.  That’s a different property than the rectangular prism, so your brain is starting to classify these in different ways.  Some of you may remember that on the test yesterday that you took, the predictive test, there was a question on there that said “What is true about a cube?”  And it said it had like six faces or sides.",teacher,128,4,,,0.0

"A line.  Look at the definition.  It’s the middle one.  An edge is the line segment where two faces meet.  Can a line ever be curved like this?  No, a line is always straight.
