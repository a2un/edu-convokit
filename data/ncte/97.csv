Feet.,student,1,0,,,
"Feet.  All right.  Feet.  Wow.  These are all excellent answers.  Those are all excellent answers as to something that you may think about when you think about measurement. Today that’s what we’re going to be working on.  One of our units in math is measurement and we really haven’t touched on it yet but today I want to just kind of introduce you to measurement because a lot of the times a teacher will say, “Okay, we’re gonna work on measurement.  First we’re gonna talk about perimeter and then we’re gonna talk about area. And then we’re gonna talk about volume and you really don’t get to see, play around, touch, feel, understand what it is that is being measured, what you need to use to measure something, all of those different things.  And when to use something and when to not use something when you are measuring something. So, first we’re gonna start off, I’m gonna give you your sheet that we’ll walk through today during our assignment.  Then once we’re finished you’ll have an activity on the back to complete on your own.  So, today, we’re just gonna get started.  We’re gonna talk about the different attributes and units of measurement.  That’s our vocabulary for today. Attributes and units.  And you’ll find out what measurement is.  The definition of measurement in one moment. Can I have the paper collectors hand out – I mean paper passers hand out the papers to everyone in the class.  Once you get your paper, make sure you write your name and today’s date at the top of your page and today’s assignment is all about measurement, introduction to measurement.  Oh, you forgot Student D. Okay.  So, now that you have your paper, does everyone have their name and today’s date at the top of their page?",teacher,304,20,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Excellent.  Excellent.  Excellent.  So right now what we’re going to do is we’re going to go over what is measurement. Following that we are going to go over what are attributes and what are units.  At the top of your page you have the unit – I mean you have the definition of measurement. Measurement – can you all follow along with me as I read? Member when I stop you will pick up.  Okay?

Light it is.,student,3,0,,,
"How light something is.  Or how much force that object is being pulled down in gravity.  So if it’s a lot of force in that object, like if it’s really heavy, it’s pulling down a lot. So, it’s heavier.   If it’s lighter don’t need as much force to be pulled down because it’s not that heavy of an object.  So that’s weight.  The next one?",teacher,65,0,,,0.0

"Give me a thumbs up if you think it’s a yes?  Thumbs down if you think it’s a no.  Why do you think it’s a no, Student K?",teacher,28,0,,,1.0
I think it’s a no because sometimes you measure something that don’t have numbers.  That’s all.,student,16,1,,1.0,

Okay.  Because I could go faster but you – now you made a good point.  I could probably do it faster with a ruler or a yardstick.  But that doesn’t mean that I won’t be able to use this to measure the length of this table.  Who said yes?,teacher,49,4,0.0,,0.0
Me.,student,1,0,,,
"Student T, why did you say yes?",teacher,7,0,,,1.0
I said – I said yes because cubes – cubes – I think they represent one inch.,student,17,2,,1.0,
One inch?,teacher,2,0,1.0,,0.0

"Oh, so you think you could just use this as an inch and then put the – how would you do that?",teacher,22,0,,,1.0
Put like – put ‘em close together.,student,7,0,,,
Okay.,teacher,1,0,0.0,,0.0
And then put ‘em – put ‘em – eh – eh – eh – in the same and then count and see how many inches – eh – eh –,student,30,0,,0.0,
"Were you gonna say the same thing, Student K?",teacher,9,0,0.0,,0.0
Yeah.,student,1,0,,,
"Yes.  That’s exactly what you can do.  Even though these are little blocks, this can still be considered a unit of measurement.  All you have to do is take one here, put one there.",teacher,34,2,,,0.0
Are you gonna do the whole table?,student,7,1,,,
"No, I’m not.  I know that would be crazy.  We would be here probably until past 3:15.  But, yes, I would take one at a time and just line ‘em up completely along this table and then what would – how would I know what the measurement is in cubes?  In these little cubes?  How would I know?  Yes, Student T?",teacher,61,4,1.0,,0.0
Count ‘em.,student,2,0,,,
"Yes.  All I would have to do – even though there’s no numbers on there – all I would have to do is count how many it would take until it got to the end here and however many cubes I had at the end, that would tell me how many cubes would be needed for the length of this table.  So, these are a form of measurement and this is one form, or one unit, that I will use today during class. So, in order to measure something you have to find a comparison.  You have to find like the same at some point and when I say this I don’t mean they’re supposed to be perfect. Sometimes measurements are off a little bit.  They’re not exactly on target.  But at the same time it doesn’t mean that it couldn’t be done.  It doesn’t mean that you couldn’t get close. So you want to say something is about this much weight or something is about this much tall or something is about this long or something to that nature. So, we’re gonna try – we’re gonna try different – we’re gonna find different attributes using what we have up here.  We’re gonna use different attributes and units and then we’re gonna have the questions that we need the next time we want to measure something.  Next time you want to measure and you’re not sure and someone says, “Oh, I need you to find the weight of something,” you don’t have to think, “Oh, they want the weight.  Oh, I think – I think they want to know how much it takes to cover something.”  Mm-mm.  You will be completely clear after today So, are you all ready?",teacher,289,12,,,0.0

"This here?  Yeah.  That’s a [Inaudible] balance.  Okay.  You can use a [pan] balance.  You can use a pan balance. Anyone else?  Something that is commonly used in households all across America to weigh people. This is now January 6.  January 1 some people said, “Oh, I gotta lose some weight.”  Or, “Oh, I’ve gained some weight.”  And I want to use this to find out how much weight I gained. What is that?

"Oh, yeah.  That’s a different – that’s a kind of a scale. That’s definitely a – when you go to the supermarket and they have those – oh, sometimes people can – wait, wait, wait.  Sometimes people can measure their fruits and their vegetables and it’s like a – has like the two poles and you have like the bottom piece and it has like the numbers at the top.  And then you put your fruit in there and it’ll tell you if it’s a pound.  ‘Cause a lot of things you buy in the fresh section of the supermarket is, um, is, um, you have to pay by the pound.  So they may say, “Oh, you want a pound of apples, that’s $2.39.”  So some people say, “I just want exactly one pound so I don’t have to pay anymore than $2.39.”  They put it in there and if it says a pound and a half, what do they have to do?",teacher,163,7,,,0.0
Take some out.,multiple students,3,0,,,
"They have to take some out so, yes, that’s definitely – the scale in the supermarket is definitely one that you could use.  Another thing you may not have seen too much is a spring.  Who knows what a spring look like?  Kind of – yeah, loopy.",teacher,47,1,,,0.0

"Yeah.  You could put spring.  So, this is the question that you always need to ask yourself in terms of weight.  This is the question that you always need to ask.

We’re gonna use today are units.  So let me put that one on there as well, units. One of the questions that you could ask yourself is, “Hm, how many units would it take to equal the same amount of weight as this container here?”  That’s one of the questions that you – so you could say how many units are equal to – how many units are equal to the weight of his object?  How many units are equal to the weight of this object?  That’s one question you can ask yourself. Once you finish writing that question I’ll show you an example of what I mean.",teacher,147,6,,,0.0

Everyone get a look at the cubes?   I want to ask you how many cubes do you think it would take if I put this on this side and these cubes on the other side?
