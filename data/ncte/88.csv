Cubic units.  What else?  What is the volume of something telling me?  How much it can – what?,teacher,18,3,,,1.0
Hold.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"How much it can hold.  So volume tells how many cubic units a box can hold.  So for example, if we had a box that was – let's see.  I'm going to draw a box, and you can do your best to draw it in to your notebook, okay?  I remember yesterday we talked about a trick how to do it.  Do you remember the trick how to draw the boxes?",teacher,71,3,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
Should I show you again?,teacher,5,0,,,1.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"So what I do is I make a square, or a rectangle, then I make another square that's kind of going in to that first square, then I just connect all my bottoms, and my top corners, and then I have a box.  That's one way of drawing it.  So I have my box here, and I am going to give it a length.  So the length is going to be 6.  The width is going to be 3, and the height is going to be 2, and the unit here is just – we're going to use unit centimeters, okay?  These are centimeters.",teacher,104,10,,,0.0
6 times 3 times 2?,student,5,0,,,

Ms. T taught you that too?  It's great we're all working on the same math concept.,teacher,16,0,,,0.0
18.,student,1,0,,,
So you got 18 for that.  So the bottom layer is made out of 18 cubes.  How many layers do I have?,teacher,22,1,,,0.0
2.,student,1,0,,,
"I have 2 layers.  That means I have 2 times 18 which is giving me – 18 times 18, so—",teacher,20,0,,,0.0
36.,student,1,0,,,
"If you just know it, you can write 36.  If you didn't just know it, you could add two 18s, right?  8 plus 8 is 6, carry the 1, 1 plus 1 is 2 plus 1 is 3.  So am I done if I just write 36?",teacher,47,1,,,0.0
No.,multiple students,1,0,,,
"I need to do 36 cubic – then I need to go look at my label, right?  In this case, CS stands for—",teacher,23,0,,,0.0
Centimeters.,student,1,1,,,
"Centimeters, but instead if I had inches there, then I would write inches, right?  If I had feet I would write feet.  If I had yards, I would write yards, but the one thing that stays the same is this right here, cubic.  Then I'm not sure if Ms. T talked to you about this or not, but another way you can write it, cubic centimeters, is by going like that.  Because the 3 stands for how many dimensions?  1, 2, 3 dimensions.  To see this, you would read it as 36 cubic centimeters.  Same way you would read it if you had written a word, but this 3 stands for cubic, okay?",teacher,113,7,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,

Could you say it again?,teacher,5,0,,,0.0

"36, so the volume is 36.  How many cubes are going to fit in there?",teacher,15,2,,,0.0
36.,student,1,0,,,
"36 of them, right.  So if I had cubes that were equal to one centimeter, each of them, then I would be able to fit 36 of them in here, and yesterday, and the day before when we did our project, we found that, right?  If we were to take the cubes here, and I was to build this box, you guys think that it would be 36 cubes that would fill it up?  So what is the bottom layer going to be again?  Can you guys do the bottom layer for me?  I'm going to have you guys build the bottom layer for me.  Then how many bottom layers do I need – how many layers do I need all together?  What's the height?",teacher,125,4,,,0.0

In the back, if you were to build – if they were building 2 layers for me – each of them is going to have 6 cubes, 3 times.  That's how many cubes?  What's your guess?  What's 6, Student P, 3 times?",teacher,66,2,,,0.0

18.  So they're going to have 18.  How many are they going to have?,teacher,14,0,,,0.0

"Ms. H, [inaudible].",student,3,0,,,
"I think it's okay, but thank you.  I'll twist it.  Thanks.  So did you build it?  So how many cubes are in there?  Student A had a guess, because it's a 6 by 3, and she guessed there'd be 18.  Is she right?",teacher,43,1,,,0.0
Yes.,multiple students,1,0,,,

18.,student,1,0,,,
"18.  So we had 18, and we had 18.  This is the bottom layer, and it's telling me there's two of these layers, right?  So I have 18 and 18, and that gives me what?",teacher,35,0,,,0.0
36.,multiple students,1,0,,,
So how many cubes are in here?,teacher,7,1,,,0.0

"Exactly.  So Student M is saying that in this box I can only put up to 36.  The most I can put in is 36, but I can put in any number of cubes that is smaller than 36.  Can you give me an example of how many cubes can fit in here?",teacher,53,2,,,1.0

11 cubes could fit in here because that's less than 36.,teacher,11,1,,,0.0

It's just the outside.,teacher,4,0,,,0.0

"But because this is made out of actual cubes, you can't see, but if I had another box – maybe I can remember to bring in a box tomorrow so we can see it.  Maybe we can measure that and see how many cubes would fit in to there.  So we're imagining this is a box.  Student A, if this was empty in the middle, and it was just like the outside, then we would be able to fit 11 cubes in here.",teacher,83,4,,,0.0

"Okay.  Student M, that was a good point.  Thank you.  So today because I know you've been practicing volume with Ms. T, and we've been practicing it here, I'm going to give you an opportunity to do some independent work, and we're going to go over it to see what you know how to do.  We're going to start off together, then I'm going to give you a chance to do a little bit by yourself.",teacher,76,1,,,0.0

Student M, Student A, Student A, Student L, Student C, Student J is not here, so I will leave his packet [inaudible].  So I have this – I photocopied all of these so we could do it up front too, so it wouldn't be a guessing game.  Student M, I copied your packet, so your name is on it.  Can you see that?  Can you turn off one of the lights for us, Student A so that everyone can see this better?",teacher,118,0,,,0.0

It's already done on the paper, but if you could do it with us again, just as a practice, that would be good.  So that means I'm going to multiply 5 times 2 times 3.

The first box is a 4 by 3 by 2.  So which one of your boxes is the 4 by 3 by 2?  This is one is it?  So 4 by 3, and then 2 high?  That's the first box is like what you have? What's the volume here?

So basically the number of it is telling me how to draw it or build it, but if the numbers are all the same, it doesn't matter what order they're in.  You're still getting 24, right?  Now say there was a third box I wanted to be a 3 by 4 by 2.  That's different than what's up there, right?  3 times 4 gives me – no, 3 times 4 gives me—",teacher,113,0,,,0.0

"12, and I already have 2 12s, 2 layers, 24.  So really I didn't need to build two boxes.  I could just build one box and twist it around.  So it doesn't matter how you multiply it or what order you multiply it in.  The number that are [inaudible] try to draw a picture of it, okay?  So sometimes, like if I was trying to multiply this, but I was multiplying 5 times 9 times 2, [inaudible].  I could find the 10.  5 times 2 times 9 is 90.  You can multiply it any way that makes it easier for you.  If you know 9 times 5 is 45, right, times 2 is – you know 9 times 2 is 18.  If I multiply that by 5, what would I get?  It would be 90.  So it doesn't matter what order you do it in.  The order is only important if you're trying to [inaudible].  Would you go on and try 3 from page 2?  So you were calling me.

When you're done with that, I have a challenge [inaudible] for you.  So look.  You're just starting to build nonsense.  I don’t appreciate that. So we're going to keep these cubes up here for a little bit.  We don't need your box.  We have two of her boxes. So you built two boxes.  Student L said he didn't need to build two boxes.  You just needed to build one box, and he's right.  So, but you're right too.  You built two boxes.  You built one box, and you're both right.  How can that be?",teacher,164,2,,,1.0

"What do you mean?  This looks different.  This one's different than this one.  That's the trick with the multiplying.

So if I try to build a 4 by 2 by 3, the 4 will be looking at me, the 3 will be the width, and the height would be the 2, right?  Then if I was trying to build a 2 – Student A, over here please.  If I was doing the 2 times 3 times 4, this is the 2 by 3 by 4, the box would look like this if I had to build it, but if all I was worried about was just finding the volume, and not drawing it or building it, it wouldn't matter how multiplied it, because when you did 4 times 3, what did you get?  4 times 3 is—",teacher,164,3,,,1.0

If what I'm trying to do is build it, then does the order matter?  Yes, because it's going to look different this way versus this way, but the volume will be the same.
